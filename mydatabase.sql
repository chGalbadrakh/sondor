Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test this WordPress 5.0 Beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-beta5.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reminder: the WordPress 5.0 release date has changed</strong>. It is now scheduled for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\">November 27</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big issues that we’ve fixed since Beta 4:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has been updated to match the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-november-2/\">Gutenberg 4.4 release</a>, the major changes  include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&nbsp;A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11874\">permalink panel has been added to the document sidebar</a> to make it easier to find.</li><li>Editor document panels can now be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11802\">programmatically removed</a>.</li><li>The uploading indicator for images and galleries has been replaced with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11876\">spinner and faded out image</a>.</li><li>The text and code editing blocks will now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11750\">use the full width of the editor</a>.</li><li>Image handling has been improved. Images now  take up the right amount of space for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11846\">themes with wider editors</a> (like Twenty Nineteen).<br></li><li>Hover styles are now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10333\">correctly disabled for mobile devices</a>.</li><li>The i18n module has been refactored to benefit from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11493\">significant performance gains</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, there have been some pesky bugs fixed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Better handling for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11590\">links without an href</a> attribute, which were showing as <code>undefined</code>.</li><li>Japanese text (double byte characters) are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11908\">now usable in the list block</a>.</li><li>Better handling for different text encodings (e.g. emoji) within a block <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11771\">in block validation</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A full list of changes can be found in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-november-2/\">Gutenberg 4.4 release post</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PHP 7.3 Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final known PHP 7.3 compatibility issue has been fixed. You can brush up on what you need to know about PHP 7.3 and WordPress by checking out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/15/wordpress-and-php-7-3/\">developer note on the Make WordPress Core blog</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Work on making Twenty Nineteen ready for prime time continues on its <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">GitHub repository</a>.

You can create flexible, beautiful content without writing a single line of code, or you can dive into the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\">modern programming APIs</a> that the block editor provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before you install WordPress 5.0, you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">try the block editor here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we recognise you might not be ready for this change quite yet. If that&#8217;s the case, you can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> now, which will keep the editor you&#8217;re familiar with as the default, even after you upgrade to WordPress 5.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the new block editor, we have a new default theme, called Twenty Nineteen, which takes advantage of the new features the block editor provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read more about Twenty Nineteen in its <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/\">introduction post</a>, and follow along with development over on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Default Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we couldn&#8217;t release a beautiful new default theme, and leave all of our old ones behind. All the way back to Twenty Ten, we&#8217;ve updated every default them to look good in the new block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a> <strong>A known issue</strong>: the block autocompleter fails for blocks whose names contain  characters in non-Latin scripts. Adding blocks via the plus sign works, and this bug is fixed in the Gutenberg 4.1 plugin. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>If you think you’ve found a bug</em></strong><em>, you can post to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\"><em>Alpha/Beta area</em></a><em>&nbsp;in the support forums.

In addition, the Gutenberg team has published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/26/an-update-on-gutenberg-tasks/\">a comprehensive guide</a> to the features currently included in the editor.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can test Gutenberg right now by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">the plugin</a>, which currently has over 450,000 active installs according to the new <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\">Gutenberg in Numbers</a> site. Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/faq/\">the Gutenberg Handbook</a> has some very useful information about how to use and develop for the new editor.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

One of the primary factors for this change is that Gutenberg is nearly ready to be considered for merging into Core, with the goal to complete the merge in v5.0.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain flexibility in the development process the final timelines are not yet determined, allowing work already done for v4.9.9 to be moved to v5.0 if needed.

While this was a maintenance release fixing 46 bugs, it was significant for Core development because it made a point of highlighting Gutenberg — the new WordPress editor that is currently in development (more on that below).<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release also included some important updates to the privacy tools that were added to Core earlier this year.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/faq/\">the Gutenberg Handbook</a> has some very useful information about how to use and develop for the new editor.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

It is designed to bring communities together to translate WordPress into their local languages, and to help them connect with other communities doing the same thing.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been three Translation Days since April 2016, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2018/08/29/global-wordpress-translation-day-4-preliminary-planning/\">the fourth edition is in the planning stages now</a>.

RC was expected Monday but those urging its delay cited the large number of open issues on the milestone and the fact that many confirmed bugs are being aggressively punted to followup releases.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not see how we can seriously ship a release candidate today,&#8221; Joe McGill said. &#8220;In doing so, we are either saying we’re ok with shipping a major version of WordPress with this many known issues, or that the term &#8216;release candidate&#8217; does not actually have meaning. I would suggest that we revise the schedule to push back RC for at least 4 weeks so we have a reasonable deadline and, in the mean time, continue releasing betas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nearly every contributor involved in the discussion was enthusiastic about Gutenberg but urged release lead Matt Mullenweg to allow for four weeks of RC and code freeze to give the community to prepare. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#8211; Building site with Gutenberg<br />&#8211; Find bug, go to GH to file an issue <br />&#8211; Find the ticket already exists.<br />&#8211; Bug has already been punted to \"5.0.x Follow Ups\"<br />&#8211; Find all the other *known* bugs planned for 5.0 launch</p>\n<p>:(<a href=\"https://t.co/EiXR8tgHnz\">https://t.co/EiXR8tgHnz</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Bill Erickson (@BillErickson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillErickson/status/1064619368045252608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contributors said they don&#8217;t understand the rush to get 5.0. Several noted that Gutenberg seems to be measured by a different rod of success than previous releases where headline features were held to a different standard in regards to shipping known bugs. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re fast approaching a million (Jetpack tracked) posts made through the editor, with the non-tracked number probably a multiple of that,&#8221; Mullenweg said in response to contributors&#8217; concerns. &#8220;There’s been an explosion of plugins building on top of Gutenberg and some things like the work ACF and Block Lab have done that seem really transformational for WordPress. For those whom the editor is not a good fit they can opt in at any point, including post-5.0, to Classic and continue using WP exactly as they had before until at least 2022 and likely beyond.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Mullenweg identified a few questions he sees as &#8220;good measures of success for Gutenberg:&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are people, when given the choice, choosing to use it over the old editor?</li>\n<li>Can they create things they weren’t able to create before?</li>\n<li>Are new-to-WP users more successful (active, happy with what they create) than pre-Gutenberg?</li>\n<li>Are interesting things being built on top of it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interesting plugins are being built on top of Gutenberg but they are breaking with every release of the plugin. Gutenberg 4.5 was released yesterday, matching the first 5.0 RC feature set. It includes a large number of changes and bug fixes that have gone relatively untested by the community at large. Most notably, 4.5 introduced a regression that caused a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/12148\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">white screen of death when trying to load custom post types</a> in the classic editor, forcing a 4.5.1 release earlier in the day. Every release introduces changes that cause plugins to break, requiring immediate updates from plugin developers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg</a> development cycle<br />1) New version of GB is released<br />2) We cross our fingers<br />3) Find out GB breaks stuff<br />4) Fix GB issues<br />5) Issue release<br />6) New version of GB released<br />repeat process <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f613.png\" alt=\"😓\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; pootlepress (@pootlepress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1065146009964212225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura posted an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/21/5-0-gutenberg-status-update-nov-21/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> today, confirming that WordPress 5.0 will miss the planned November 27 release date but did not offer a secondary date.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The date for 5.0 release is under consideration, given it’s not plausible for it to be the on 27th,&#8221; Ventura said. </p>\n<h3>WordPress 5.0 Will Ship &#8220;When It&#8217;s Ready,&#8221; Contributors are Focusing on Getting Release Candidate out ASAP</h3>\n<p>When the second set of November dates for release were missed, many assumed WordPress 5.0 would fall back to the secondary dates in January, but that has not yet been confirmed. The previous <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/proposed-wordpress-5-0-scope-and-schedule/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scope and schedule Gary Pendergast outlined</a> said the November dates could slip by up to eight days if necessary and that if additional time was required, they would aim for the January dates:</p>\n<p>Secondary RC 1: January 8, 2019</p>\n<p>Secondary Release: January 22, 2019 </p>\n<p>During the regularly scheduled core developers&#8217; chat today, the discussion regarding WordPress 5.0&#8217;s release date became heated, as contributors continued to push for a January release. Pendergast suggested that December might have a viable date, to which Yoast CEO Joost de Valk responded, &#8220;I’m going to raise hell if we do December.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress plugin developers and agencies are trying to plan for upcoming holidays and want to have staff available when the release lands. Many of those who attended the meeting were hoping to receive confirmation on the release being pushed back to January.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please also consider the plugin shops that are rearranging their priorities to have blocks ready for 5.0, only to have had to fix them several times in the last few weeks,&#8221; Kevin Hoffman said. &#8220;The success of 5.0 depends just as much on third-party support as it does core.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s agreement on that from all sides, that the amount of code churn and missed earlier deadlines means that the 27th is untenable,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;RC is still possible soon, but please don&#8217;t assume that implies a final release date until we see how that goes and pick one. I hope that it shows that we are willing to change decisions based on new information, it&#8217;s not about being &#8216;right&#8217; or sticking to previous plans blindly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This statement indicates Mullenweg may be considering dates that were not included in the original schedule, as he later said,&#8221;If y&#8217;all can take the data without freaking out about what it means for the release date, there have been 8 major releases in December, it&#8217;s actually been 34% of our last 23 major releases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several contributors agreed that getting an RC out ASAP would finally force a longer code freeze for Gutenberg&#8217;s UI, API, documentation, and features. This would give the community more time to prepare. </p>\n<p>&#8220;As part of the development team for almost two years now, I’d love for us to draw the RC line soon for the sake of everyone’s fatigue,&#8221; Matias Ventura said. &#8220;And think it’s ready to be drawn. I am concerned with letting us do &#8216;one more little thing&#8217; and pushing the stability line further down, in an almost endless process.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Contributors are now wrapping up the last few tickets and the plan is to get the release candidate out tomorrow during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Given WordPress&#8217; global contributor base, releasing on the holiday shouldn&#8217;t be an issue. The team is also still investigating the possibility of bundling the Classic Editor plugin with updates for existing WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our focus right now is on a great RC,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Throughout Gutenberg&#8217;s development Mullenweg has said WordPress 5.0 would ship &#8220;when it&#8217;s ready.&#8221; No release date will be announced until the team has had time to evaluate the release candidate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is true that the primary thing is whether it&#8217;s ready, and it&#8217;s not currently ready,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>In 1928, John A. Shedd published a little book called “Salt from My Attic.&#8221; It included a saying that U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper said was influential in her life: &#8220;A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Shipping a major overhaul of WordPress&#8217; editor has brought a fair share of uncertainty and frustration to contributors and the community that depends on the software. After mission-critical issues have been resolved, it seems to become a cycle of fixing and breaking things that could continue indefinitely. Although the holiday timing isn&#8217;t ideal, if Gutenberg stalls much longer it&#8217;s going to be burning daylight.

The content management system is an evolution of the pMachine blogging software first released in early 2002. EllisLab previously required a license fee to use the full version of ExpressionEngine, which is built on object-oriented PHP and uses MySQL for storage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although open source was a viable licensing model when we launched our first CMS back in 2002, it was not apparent then just how dominant open source would become on the web,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;It wasn’t until Eric Raymond wrote The Cathedral &#038; The Bazaar that open source would even begin to enter the general public’s consciousness. Since then we’ve watched the open source market grow rapidly and continuously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, over 90% of the CMS market is open source. In fact, it’s nearly the de-facto license model for all-things web. Stunningly, the market is expected to triple in revenue within the next five to ten years, and it’s estimated that over 70% of businesses worldwide rely on open-source software. To say that the internet is open source would not be an exaggeration. It’s that dominant.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ellis said he had wanted to migrate to an open source license for a long time but had not yet found &#8220;the right strategic and financial partner to enable the full vision of what we hope to achieve.&#8221; The first part of EllisLab&#8217;s business plan is to build a successful services model and then branch out from there.</p>\n<p>Prior to licensing ExpressionEngine under the <a href=\"https://expressionengine.com/license\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>, EllisLab&#8217;s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180627183126/https://expressionengine.com/license\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commercial license</a> imposed severe restrictions on what users could do with the software. Users were not permitted to do any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the Core License (free) for any client or contract work.</li>\n<li>Use the Software as the basis of a hosted blogging service, or to provide hosting services to others.</li>\n<li>Reproduce, distribute, or transfer the Software, or portions thereof, to any third party.</li>\n<li>Modify, tamper with, bypass, or in any way impede license registration routines in the Software.</li>\n<li>Sell, rent, lease, assign, or sublet the Software or portions thereof, including sites in your multi-site license.</li>\n<li>Grant rights to any other person.</li>\n<li>Use the Software in violation of any U.S. or international law or regulation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional stipulations encouraged users not to share code by keeping their repositories private, and to make sure they were paying for commercial licenses if they were being paid for their work. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-20-at-1.35.18-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>There was simply no way ExpressionEngine could capture any significant amount of market share with this kind of restrictive licensing and its usage has steadily declined over the years. It is currently used by <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-expressionengine/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0.3% of all the websites</a> whose content management system w3techs can detect. By this or any other measure of market share, ExpressionEngine stands as a sobering monument to the importance of giving a project a license that empowers its community to continue adding wood to the fire.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The community is mostly gone at this point and I don&#8217;t even think its related to them charging for the software but they just stopped responding people and helping them in their forums,&#8221; reddit user @netzvolk <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/9ylq4i/expressionengine_is_now_open_source/ea2g130/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the news.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have paid EE multiple times in the past but considered NOT paying anymore because third party developers are gone, the community members are gone, the tutorials and books are gone&#8230;.EE 2 was the best version so far. Moving to yearly releases also caused more harm than good in terms of building a stable ecosystem around the product.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpressionEngine&#8217;s new open source licensing is a major win for its remaining users. How much further down the road would the software be if the decision was made years ago? There&#8217;s no way to know, but moving forward users will have more input and influence over the future of the software. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I suspect open sourcing EE is an approach to get that community and developers back,&#8221; @netzvolk <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/9ylq4i/expressionengine_is_now_open_source/ea2n7ce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;EllisLab can still make money with consulting, support and add-ons.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But all those suffer if nobody is using the product anymore. This is more about expanding reach to stay afloat than anything else because some of their past bad decisions are what created alternatives like <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Craft</a>. EllisLab turned an amazing product into a forgotten one in just a few years. I hope this means some change, and maybe, maybe one day the old developers and hard core EE community members come back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Users can only speculate on why EllisLab is making this move after 16 years of keeping its software locked down under restrictive licensing, but Ellis makes it clear in his post that the market decided long ago.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Open source has won,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;It’s not even a contest anymore.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:21:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Figma Partners with WordPress to Improve Design Collaboration\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85769\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/figma-partners-with-wordpress-to-improve-design-collaboration\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3679:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-19-at-8.43.27-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Figma</a>, an online collaborative interface design tool, has donated an organizational membership to the WordPress project.

Rob Stinson, Luke Carbis, and Rheinard Korf, all employees at <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">XWP</a>, kicked off the project in their own time with the goal of removing the relatively steep barrier to block creation. The plugin is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-lab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">now available on WordPress.org</a> and Stinson said their target audience is WordPress developers ranging from junior to experienced.</p>\n<p>The Block Lab admin screen lets users select an icon for the custom block, enter keywords, and choose from a variety of input fields. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/block-lab-admin.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Rendering the custom blocks in the editor and on the frontend requires simple PHP functions that most WordPress developers are probably already familiar with. Here&#8217;s an example for a testimonial block from the <a href=\"https://github.com/getblocklab/block-lab/wiki/Displaying-custom-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugin&#8217;s documentation</a>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">\n&lt;img src=\"&lt;?php block_field( \'profile-picture\' ); ?&gt;\" alt=\"&lt;?php block_field( \'author-name\' ); ?&gt;\" /&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;?php block_field( \'author-name\' ); ?&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php block_field( \'testimonial\' ); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>The plugin makes it possible to build custom blocks in a matter of minutes, as demonstrated in the video below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Block Lab Puts Block Creation Inside the WordPress Admin</h3>\n<p>Block Lab differs from existing block creation tools in that it aims to provide a Gutenberg-first solution directly inside the WordPress admin. With the exception of the template creation, developers are not required to write any code when using it to create blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ahmad’s <a href=\"https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create-gluten-block</a> is an excellent solution, but is more focused on streamlining block creation from the ground floor,&#8221; Stinson said. &#8220;As I understand, it’s a development framework. Block Lab is about letting the developer kick off from the 10th floor and does this by offering a super simple WP Admin and traditional templating  experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Stinson said <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/acf-5-8-beta-1-introduces-blocks-feature-release-slated-for-november\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ACF&#8217;s solution</a> was one of the inspirations for his team but that Block Lab tackles block creation from a different angle. </p>\n<p>&#8220;ACF is amazing as well &#8211; easily one of our all time favorite plugins and one that has inspired us,&#8221; Stinson said. &#8220;Block Lab is a Gutenberg-first solution. Where ACF is a meta data first solution. They both arrive at similar destinations but get there by very different means, both technically and as far as UX goes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Developers and users who adopt Block Labs should be aware that if the plugin is deactivated, the custom blocks they created will also be deactivated. They are stored in the database and the templates are stored in the theme or child theme. Switching themes means users will lose the blocks as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adding templates to a stand-alone plugin is the most effective way around this,&#8221; Stinson said. &#8220;Either way though, the templating is simple enough that copying template folders/files from one theme to another is pretty easy. I did this exact thing yesterday in about 5 minutes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Data portability isn&#8217;t a guarantee for users right now, but Stinson said his team has some ideas about how they can reduce barriers even further to include an in-admin templating experience. </p>\n<p>Block Lab&#8217;s creators have plans to offer commercial extensions eventually, but at this stage they are focusing on solving the problem for users in the free plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we better understand what folks are needing, we’ll find a way of gracefully offering premium stuff,&#8221; Stinson said.  </p>\n<p>There are still many unknowns about how the larger community of WordPress users will react to the upcoming 5.0 release, but Stinson is convinced that Gutenberg will have a positive impact on the plugin ecosystem and users&#8217; experiences with extensions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is going to, ultimately, change things for the better in the plugin ecosystem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is no doubt it’s going to be bumpy for the first little while, but the net effect is that WordPress will have a better editing experience in general and one that gives plugin developers a stronger baseline for extending the editing experience.

Jorge Bernal, a mobile engineer at Automattic, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2018/11/15/gutenberg-in-the-apps-what-to-expect/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">posted an update</a> yesterday, highlighting current capabilities:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gutenberg Mobile [is] working inside the apps and the first post published with it, the writing flow has improved so it’s starting to feel more like an editor and less like a collection of isolated blocks, we have a working toolbar in place, you can now select images from your media library.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are using one of the mobile apps and you attempt to edit a post that was created with Gutenberg, you will see a warning like the one below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot_20181116-170549.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean users cannot edit content in the mobile apps, but there will be inconsistencies while Gutenberg support is still in progress. </p>\n<p>I created some posts with Gutenberg and then went to edit them in the Android app. During my tests of switching back to the Gutenberg editor after saving some changes in the mobile app, I found that Gutenberg included the content but not the formatting options I had selected in the app. I received a warning about unexpected or invalid content. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-16-at-5.08.13-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The mobile apps team expects to ship an <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile/milestone/4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">alpha release</a> to testers at the end of 2018, with basic capabilities like adding a heading, paragraph, and images from the media library:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will have an alpha release at the end of the year that will showcase the editing flow with some selected basic blocks. We will have a basic integration with the apps, enough to be able to experience Gutenberg (via secret opt-in or special builds), but won’t be showing this to users. Being able to use early versions of Gutenberg directly in the apps will make it easier to gather feedback and do user testing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A beta with support for the most common types of content is tentatively planned for February 2019. The team is aiming to make writing a post using Gutenberg Mobile as pleasant as it currently is with Aztec.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As Gutenberg rolls out to users on the web, we might see a good amount of users hitting problems trying to edit Gutenberg posts on Aztec,&#8221; Bernal said. &#8220;We have done (and keep doing) a lot of work to try to make that as good as possible, but there are limits to how compatible we can make the existing editor. We want to reduce the gap between Gutenberg launching and having a version in the apps, so we’re adjusting scope a bit to ship in February.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how Gutenberg support is presented in the apps. I imagine it will be challenging to improve upon the mobile apps&#8217; current editing experience, which is already fairly intuitive and streamlined. </p>\n<p>Users can follow along with the process and give feedback on the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Mobile</a> GitHub repo.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:52:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: How WordPress Has Changed People’s Lives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85710\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wptavern.com/how-wordpress-has-changed-peoples-lives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4877:\"<p>It&#8217;s Friday and we could probably all use a little more positivity in our lives, especially on social media.

One of the major changes in this release is the addition of a Permalink panel that is in the Document sidebar. \n\n\n\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11874\">panel was added</a> based on user feedback  that the UI for editing the permalink is difficult to discover and buggy. This method of editing the permalink does not replace the existing method of clicking the title block. \n\n\n\nIn beta 5, developers can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11802\">remove panels</a> from the document sidebar. However, if you want to add panels to the sidebar, there is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11802#issuecomment-439370494\">currently no way</a> to do it.\n\n\n\nHandling images has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11846\">been improved</a> in beta 5 as images now take up the right amount of space in themes with wider editors. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10333\">Hover styles</a> for mobile devices are disabled and the i18n module <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11493\">was refactored</a> to take advantage of performance improvements. \n\n\n\nIf WordPress 5.0 is released before the end of the year, it will include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/15/wordpress-and-php-7-3/\">PHP 7.3 compatibility fixes</a>.

The team will be joined by lead developers from <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deque Systems</a>, a widely respected accessibility firm in the industry, with the goal of setting up automated accessibility testing for WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The event has been in planning since JSconf EU 2018 in June when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miss_jwo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Wong</a> met with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caitlinthefirst\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Caitlin Cashin</a> from Deque. They discussed how Deque could help WordPress with their accessibility expertise at WordCamp US. Rian Rietveld worked with Aaron Campbell, who is organizing the WCUS contributor day, to put the hackathon in motion.</p>\n<p>Deque&#8217;s site is built on WordPress and the company specializes in helping teams get hooked up with automation tools. The company created <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aXe</a>, an open source library and testing engine that can be customized to integrate with all modern browsers and testing frameworks. Deque <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/axe-an-open-source-javascript-library-for-automating-accessibility-testing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced aXe in 2015</a> and the team was invited to contribute the library to the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2015/draft-charter-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">W3C WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group</a>, when the group worked to develop a normative set of rules for evaluating WCAG 2.0 conformance.</p>\n<p>Deque is volunteering their lead developers to help WordPress make improvements to its development workflow. The company has hosted similar hackathons in the past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By focusing primarily on projects with broad adoption, accessibility fixes have potential to trickle down to every website or web application including that library,&#8221; Deque Developer Advocate Marcy Sutton said after the <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/blog/highlights-takeaways-2nd-annual-axe-hackathon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2017 aXe hackathon in San Diego</a>. &#8220;Ultimately, this kind of work will have the most impact on the lives of people with disabilities, as it contributes to the creation of a more accessible workplace environment. A more accessible web also means a better user experience for everyone, part of the reason why digital accessibility is so important.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order for the hackathon at WordCamp US to be successful, Deque will need to connect to contributors who can collaborate on setting up automated testing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From the WordPress side we would like to invite core developers to join in and help find solutions to set this up,&#8221; Accessibility Team rep Jean-Baptiste Audras said. He and contributor Rachel Cherry will be representing the accessibility team during the hackathon and they need help from core committers who know their way around the automated testing system in WordPress core. Audras also said the team will need help from Gutenberg contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The tools can/will provide automated tests for the block editor since it&#8217;s based on testing the DOM (Document Object Model) of each admin screen generated by WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we have to build it together with the people involved in Gutenberg to see how we can handle it the best way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Audras said the Gutenberg phase 2 release leads have already been in touch with the accessibility team and communication across teams is improving.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we find a technical solution, there should ideally not be technical problems to implement it,&#8221; Audras said. &#8220;As usual, it will be a question of priority and communication. I am confident that Gutenberg developers will be interested to add some automated checks to the Gutenberg stack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Audras said he doesn&#8217;t know when the automated tests for accessibility will be operational but he believes they will be very helpful in the future, especially in cases where new releases are being put out quickly.

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test this WordPress 5.0 Beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-beta5.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reminder: the WordPress 5.0 release date has changed</strong>. It is now scheduled for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\">November 27</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big issues that we’ve fixed since Beta 4:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has been updated to match the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-november-2/\">Gutenberg 4.4 release</a>, the major changes  include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&nbsp;A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11874\">permalink panel has been added to the document sidebar</a> to make it easier to find.</li><li>Editor document panels can now be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11802\">programmatically removed</a>.</li><li>The uploading indicator for images and galleries has been replaced with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11876\">spinner and faded out image</a>.</li><li>The text and code editing blocks will now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11750\">use the full width of the editor</a>.</li><li>Image handling has been improved. Images now  take up the right amount of space for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11846\">themes with wider editors</a> (like Twenty Nineteen).<br /></li><li>Hover styles are now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10333\">correctly disabled for mobile devices</a>.</li><li>The i18n module has been refactored to benefit from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11493\">significant performance gains</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, there have been some pesky bugs fixed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Better handling for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11590\">links without an href</a> attribute, which were showing as <code>undefined</code>.</li><li>Japanese text (double byte characters) are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11908\">now usable in the list block</a>.</li><li>Better handling for different text encodings (e.g. emoji) within a block <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11771\">in block validation</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A full list of changes can be found in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-november-2/\">Gutenberg 4.4 release post</a>.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PHP 7.3 Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final known PHP 7.3 compatibility issue has been fixed. You can brush up on what you need to know about PHP 7.3 and WordPress by checking out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/15/wordpress-and-php-7-3/\">developer note on the Make WordPress Core blog</a>.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Work on making Twenty Nineteen ready for prime time continues on its <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">GitHub repository</a>. This update includes <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43904\">a host of tweaks and bug fixes</a>, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add <code>.button</code> class support.</li><li>Fix editor font-weights for headings.</li><li>Improve support for sticky toolbars in the editor.</li><li>Improve text-selection custom colors for better contrast and legibility.</li><li>Fix editor to prevent Gutenberg&#8217;s meta boxes area from overlapping the content.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>If you think you’ve found a bug</em></strong><em>, you can post to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\"><em>Alpha/Beta area</em></a><em>&nbsp;in the support forums.

In response to questions about how to find Gutenberg themes on WordPress.com, <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic&#8217;s Theme Team</a> has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MRWweb/status/1062491404373356544\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">given an update</a> about the status of the .com themes, as well as the company&#8217;s free themes on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>There is currently no way to search for Gutenberg-ready themes on WordPress.com themes because there is no filter set up for this. However, the team said users should not any experience any issues with themes breaking with the new editor:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All existing themes should still work with Gutenberg. At worst styles in the editor might not exactly match styles on the site itself, and styling for individual blocks might cause conflicts if the theme treats that type of content in a specific way. But that is true of all WordPress themes, not just the ones on WordPress.com.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Users can activate any theme they want with Gutenberg. The new editor is not going to break any themes, but a theme does need to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/extensibility/theme-support/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">add support</a> for users to take advantage of specific features like wide alignments and block color palettes. Gutenberg-ready themes also include editor styles to ensure a consistent editing experience between frontend and backend.</p>\n<p>Automattic is also working to bring some of those updates from its current set of Gutenberg-ready themes to its free themes hosted on WordPress.org. The company has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/automattic/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">109 themes</a> in the directory, which have cumulatively been downloaded more than <a href=\"http://wptally.com/?wpusername=automattic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">17 million times</a>. The majority of its more popular themes fall into the business category, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/dara/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dara</a> (10K active installs), <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/argent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Argent</a> (10K), <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/edin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edin</a> (6K), and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/karuna/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Karuna (5K)</a>. Several of these themes are already Gutenberg-ready with the code <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/themes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront</a> is by far Automattic&#8217;s most popular free theme on WordPress.org with 200,000+ installs and is well on its way towards being ready to support Gutenberg&#8217;s new features. Development towards this goal is <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/storefront/tree/feature/gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">happening on GitHub</a>.

NextGEN Gallery&#8217;s Gutenberg block has been in <a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/gutenberg-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beta testing since May</a> and the plugin will support users who update to use the new editor as well as those who stick with the Classic Editor plugin.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.imagely.com/defer-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Plea to Defer the Release of Gutenberg</a>,&#8221; Danzer outlined his concerns with the timeline for WordPress 5.0. His thoughts echo many other prominent members of the development community who have written their own <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/calls-to-delay-wordpress-5-0-increase-developers-cite-usability-concerns-and-numerous-bugs-in-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">calls to delay the release</a>. He cites feedback on WordPress.org and urges the Gutenberg team not to discount the validity of these reviews:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some people have been dismissive of those reviews and questioned whether they are a legitimate reflection of user experiences with Gutenberg. The reviews often lack detail and can be quite harsh.</p>\n<p>But that’s the experience of ALL plugin developers on the WordPress repository. Gutenberg is being reviewed in precisely the same way as every other plugin on the repository. If any other major plugin maintained a 2.3 star rating and refused to accept the feedback as legitimate, it would not be a major plugin for long.</p>\n<p>Even without detail, reviews on the repository represent a fair reflection of overall user feelings about a plugin. In the case of Gutenberg, it is clear the plugin is not ‘wowing’ potential users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Danzer also referenced a release the NextGEN Gallery team shipped in 2013 that included &#8220;major and breaking changes&#8221; that had been &#8220;tested aggressively but in limited ways.&#8221; This release broke an estimated 10 percent of the plugin&#8217;s installations as well as compatibility with many extensions. It has had a lasting impact on NextGEN&#8217;s reputation for the past five years. Danzer said he fears WordPress may be headed in the same direction, except at a much larger scale.</p>\n<p>As a postscript to his plea, Danzer assured users reading his post that NextGEN Gallery will have support for Gutenberg in time for the WordPress 5.0 release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Despite the concerns expressed in this post, I want to assure NextGEN Gallery users that we&#8217;ll be ready regardless of the final release decision for Gutenberg. We&#8217;ll be officially  in the next week. We&#8217;ve tested and ensured that your existing galleries will work when you update. We&#8217;ve developed our block so that if you add galleries via Gutenberg, they will continue to work if you roll back or install the classic editor. And we&#8217;ll have all hands on deck to deal with any issues that arise when Gutenberg is released.</p></blockquote>\n<p>NextGEN Gallery&#8217;s Gutenberg support includes a block that launches a modal where users can select a gallery to insert. Unless it has significantly changed from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCazFfYz49s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beta preview video</a> published, the gallery block doesn&#8217;t seem to offer a preview of the gallery inside the Gutenberg editor once it has been selected and placed within the content.

The Drupal version of this connector plugin was introduced at DrupalCamp Oslo. Frontkom&#8217;s Per André Rønsen and Thor Andre Gretland hosted a session called &#8220;Build your pages build with Drupal Gutenberg&#8221; where they gave attendees a look at Gutenberg Cloud for D8. It runs as submodule of Drupal Gutenberg.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/c5wZ7ylbkvN\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/9giVOkXdC3.gif?resize=627%2C407&ssl=1\" alt=\"Drupal pagebuilder gutenberg\" width=\"627\" height=\"407\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Changes Coming to Gutenberg Cloud: All Blocks Will Undergo Code Review before Publishing</h3>\n<p>One of the speakers at the event was a member of the Drupal.org security team. Rønsen said after their session they had good participation during the Q&amp;A time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was some push back on Gutenberg Cloud for letting any developer add new blocks,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;We explained that this is only during beta phase, and that we do code review of new blocks coming in. However, this led to the decision of switching to white listing instead. Starting next week, block authors will need to email us and ask for code review before we accept the blocks. This will go hand in hand with an upcoming browser on gutenbergcloud.org  – meaning each block will get it&#8217;s own little landing page online. We think this will be useful for people to see how Gutenberg Cloud can be useful for their site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Overall, the Frontkom team saw a positive reception to Gutenberg Cloud at DrupalCamp Oslo and they are working to incorporate some of the valuable feedback they received.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Totally impressed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drupalgutenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@drupalgutenberg</a> demo at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/dcoslo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#dcoslo</a>.

In 2019, this <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/11/12/increase-in-wordcamp-maximum-ticket-price-for-2019/\">will increase</a> to $25 per day.</p>\n<p>The new amount accounts for inflation and provides breathing room for organizers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=20.00&year1=200601&year2=201808\">inflation calculator</a>, $20 in January of 2006 is equal to $25.51 in October of 2018.</p>\n<p>Organizers don&#8217;t have to charge this amount and are encouraged to keep the ticket price as low as possible. The increase is also part of a delicate balancing act between not being a financial burden and getting 80% or more of attendees to show up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The ticket price does not reflect on the value of the event,&#8221; Andrea Middleton, Community organizer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In an ideal world, all WordCamp tickets would be free just like WordPress is free but to avoid organizing a conference for 500 registrants and only having 50 people show up on the day of the event, we <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/selling-tickets/#the-reasons-behind-pricing-tickets-as-low-as-possible\">charge as little as we possibly can</a> for tickets, but just enough that people will show up for the event if they’re sleepy that morning or got a last-minute invitation to a pool party or something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/09/17/proposal-to-increase-the-maximum-ticket-price-for-wordcamps/\">proposal </a>to increase the maximum ticket price was published in September, many commenters approved of the increase with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/09/17/proposal-to-increase-the-maximum-ticket-price-for-wordcamps/#comment-25918\">some suggesting</a> an even higher amount to account for inflation for the next few years. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/09/17/proposal-to-increase-the-maximum-ticket-price-for-wordcamps/#comment-25885\">Ian Dunn questioned</a> whether or not budget shortfalls were due to organizing teams spending money on extra things.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond that, though, I’m curious why camps are having more trouble today than they were 5 or even 10 years ago?&#8221; Dunn said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is it harder to get sponsorships? It seems like the opposite is true, especially given how much the global sponsorship program covers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on experiences in my local community, I suspect that the primary reason for budget shortfalls is that the organizing team is choosing to do extra things, beyond what’s necessary to meet the goals of a WordCamp. For example, holding after-parties at trendy venues, expensive speaker gifts, professional A/V (which I’ve advocated for in the past, but not at the cost of higher ticket prices), etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is interesting to ponder how much money WordCamps could save globally by eliminating the materialistic aspects of the event such as t-shirts, speaker gifts, lanyards, badges, signs, etc.</p>\n<p>At there core, WordCamps are about gathering the local community together in a physical location to share knowledge. Not every WordPress event needs to mimic WordCamp US or WordCamp Europe, two of the largest events in the world.</p>\n<p>Although the WordPress Community team tracks data such as how much each WordCamp charges for ticket prices, the information is not readily available. This is because of the large volume of data that would need to be calculated and displayed. It would be interesting to see an info-graphic of this data where you can compare the average ticket price for WordCamps per country.</p>\n<p>Hugh Lashbrooke, a WordPress Community team contributor who has access to the data says that, &#8220;globally the majority of camps have lower prices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp organizers are highly encouraged to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/web-presence/using-camptix-event-ticketing-plugin/#tracking-attendance\">keep track</a> of attendance as the data is used to help make better informed decisions. The team will review the no-show rates at WordCamps at the end of 2019 to determine if the price increase had any effect. If not, the team may increase the price again for 2020.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 19:25:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: Google Developers Demo AMP Stories Integration with Gutenberg at Chrome Dev Summit\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85548\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/google-developers-demo-amp-stories-integration-with-gutenberg-at-chrome-dev-summit\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2929:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-13-at-1.18.48-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Alberto Medina and Weston Ruter gave a presentation on Progressive Content Management Systems yesterday at <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome Dev Summit 2018</a> in San Francisco. Medina is a developer advocate at Google and Ruter recently transitioned into a new role as a Developer Programs Engineer after eight years at XWP.</p>\n<p>Medina began the session with a quick overview of the increasingly complex CMS space, which is growing, according to figures he cited from w3techs: 54% of sites are built with some kind of CMS (11% YoY growth). Many CMS&#8217;s face common challenges when it comes to integrating modern web technologies into their platforms, such as large code bases, legacy code, and technical debt.</p>\n<p>In addressing the challenges that WordPress faces, Google is looking to make an impact on a large swath of the web. Medina outlined the two-part approach Google is using with the WordPress ecosystem. This includes AMP integration via the AMP plugin for WordPress. It&#8217;s currently at <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2018/11/05/amp-plugin-release-v1-0-rc2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.0 RC2</a> and the stable version is scheduled for release at the end of this month.</p>\n<p>The second part of the approach is integration of modern web capabilities and APIs in core, so that things like service workers and background sync are supported natively in a way that the entire ecosystem can take advantage of them. Google has invested resources to get these features added to core.</p>\n<p>Ruter demonstrated a single page application built in WordPress using a standard theme as the basis and the AMP plugin as a foundation.

Here are some of the big issues that we’ve fixed since Beta 3:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has been updated to match the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/12/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12th-november/\">Gutenberg 4.3 release</a>, the major changes  include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/7718\">Annotations API</a>, allowing plugins to add  contextual data as you write.</li><li>More consistent keyboard navigation between blocks, as well as back-and-forth between different areas of the interface.</li><li>Improved accessibility, with additional  labelling and speech announcements.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, there have been some bugs fixed that popped up in beta 3:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Better support for plugins that have more advanced meta box usage.</li><li>Script concatenation is now supported.</li><li>Ajax calls could occasionally cause PHP errors.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Internationalisation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added an API for translating your plugin and theme strings in JavaScript files! The block editor is now using this, and you can start using it, too.

The plugin was temporarily removed and then reinstated after the issues were patched within 24 hours by its creators, <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Van Ons</a>, a WordPress development shop based in Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>The changelog for the most recent release states that previous versions are vulnerable to SQL injection due to &#8220;wrong handling of possible user input in combination with unsafe unserialization.&#8221; The fixes are in version 1.4.3, which includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security fix: Removed base64_decode() function</li>\n<li>Security fix: Correctly escape input in $wpdb->prepare() function</li>\n<li>Security fix: Only allow modifying WordPress options used by the plugin and by the user capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Van Ons said they requested the Plugin Directory team do a forced update but they said it was not an option in this case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gdpr-compliance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP GDPR Compliance</a> has more than 100,000 active installs. According to Wordfence, the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild and many users are reporting new administrator accounts being created on their affected sites. The <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2018/11/privilege-escalation-flaw-in-wp-gdpr-compliance-plugin-exploited-in-the-wild/\">Wordfence blog</a> has a breakdown of how attackers are taking advantage of these sites:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve already begun seeing cases of live sites infected through this attack vector. In these cases, the ability to update arbitrary options values is being used to install new administrator accounts onto the impacted sites.</p>\n<p>By leveraging this flaw to set the users_can_register option to 1, and changing the default_role of new users to “administrator”, attackers can simply fill out the form at /wp-login.php?action=register and immediately access a privileged account. From this point, they can change these options back to normal and install a malicious plugin or theme containing a web shell or other malware to further infect the victim site.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wordfence has seen multiple malicious administrator accounts present on sites that have been compromised, with variations of the username t2trollherten. Several WP GDPR Compliance plugin users have commented on the Wordfence post saying they were victims of the exploit, having found new admin users with a backdoor and file injections added.</p>\n<p>The plugin has its own <a href=\"https://www.wpgdprc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> where the vulnerability was announced. Its creators recommend that anyone who didn&#8217;t update right away on November 7, 2018, should look for changes in their databases. The most obvious symptom of attack is likely to be new users with administrator privileges. Any unrecognized users should be deleted. They also recommend restoring a complete backup of the site before November 6 and then updating to version 1.4.3 right away.</p>\n<p>The WP GDPR Compliance plugin lets users add a GDPR checkbox to Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, WooCommerce, and WordPress comments. It allows visitors and customers to opt into allowing the site to handle their personal data for a defined purpose. It also allows visitors to request data stored in the website&#8217;s database through a Data Request page that allows them to request data to be deleted.</p>\n<p>While the name of the plugin includes the word &#8220;compliance,&#8221; users should note that the plugin details includes a disclaimer:</p>\n<p>&#8220;ACTIVATING THIS PLUGIN DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOU FULLY COMPLY WITH GDPR. PLEASE CONTACT A GDPR CONSULTANT OR LAW FIRM TO ASSESS NECESSARY MEASURES.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A relatively new amendment to <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#9-developers-and-their-plugins-must-not-do-anything-illegal-dishonest-or-morally-offensive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">section 9 of the plugin development guidelines</a> restricts plugin authors from implying that a plugin can create, provide, automate, or guarantee legal compliance.

This guideline is especially important for users to remember when a plugin author uses GDPR Compliance in the name of the plugin.

She asked if users will have to use Gutenberg when 5.0 is released. Mullenweg said one of the reasons Gutenberg has been tested so early is to give plugin developers time to get their products compatible. He also said that it has been the fastest growing plugin in WordPress&#8217; history, with more than 600,000 installations since it was first made available.</p>\n<p>In response to her question he said users will have the option to use the Classic Editor and that the team is considering updating it to include per-user controls and the possibility to turn it on/off for different post types.</p>\n<p>Subsequent questions went deeper into recent controversies surrounding Gutenberg, which Mullenweg addressed more in depth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The tough part of any open source project &#8211; there&#8217;s kind of a crucible of open source development which can sometimes be more adversarial and sometimes even acrimonious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Working within the same company, you can kind of assume everyone is rowing in the same direction. In a wide open source ecosystem, some people might actually want the opposite of what you&#8217;re doing, because it might be in their own economic self-interest, or for any number of reasons.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I liken it much more to being a mayor of a city than being a CEO of a company. I&#8217;ve done WordPress now for 15 years so I&#8217;m pretty used to it. It might seem kind of controversial if you&#8217;re just coming in, but this is not the most controversial thing we have ever brought into WordPress. The last time we had a big fork of WordPress was actually when we brought in WYSIWYG the first time. Maybe there&#8217;s something about messing with the editor that sets people off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg commented on how polarizing Twitter can be as a medium and how that can impact conversations in negatives ways. He said people tend to read the worst into things that have been said and that has been a new challenge during this particular time in WordPress&#8217; history. WordPress tweets are sprinkled into timelines along with politics and current events in a way that can cause people to react differently than if the discussion was held in a trac ticket, for example.</p>\n<p>One attendee asked, &#8220;With Gutenberg there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty. Where do you see the tipping point where you see people become more favorable to Gutenberg than the Classic Editor?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of getting these two plugins, Gutenberg and Classic Editor, out early, was that it could remove uncertainty for people,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Months before they were released you could kind of choose your path. The hope is that the 5.0 release day is the most anti-climactic thing ever. Because we have over a million sites that have either chosen to not use Gutenberg, which is totally ok, or have already opted in and have been getting these sometimes weekly updates. We have hosts that have been actually been pre-installing, pre-activating Gutenberg with all of their sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said hosts that have pre-installed Gutenberg have not reported a higher than normal support load and that it has basically been &#8220;a non-event.&#8221; It&#8217;s the users who are updating to 5.0 after many years of using WordPress who will have the most to learn.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg does by some measures five or ten measures more than what you could really accomplish in the classic editor,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;That also means there&#8217;s more buttons, there&#8217;s more blocks. That is part of the idea &#8211; to open up people&#8217;s flexibility and creativity to do things they would either need code or a crazy theme to do in the past. And now we&#8217;re going to open that up to do WordPress&#8217; mission, which is to democratize publishing and make it accessible to everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg&#8217;s current state of accessibility has been a hot topic lately and one attendee asked for his thoughts about the recent discussions. Mullenweg said there is room for improvement in how this aspect of the project was handled and that WordPress can work better across teams in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Accessibility has been core to WordPress from the very beginning. It&#8217;s part of why we started &#8211; adoption of web standards and accessibility things. We&#8217;ve been a member of the web standards project for many many years. We did kind of have some project management fails in this process where we had a team of volunteers that felt like they were disconnected from the rapid development that was happening with Gutenberg. Definitely there were some things we could do better there. In the future I think that we need &#8211; I don&#8217;t know if it makes sense to have separate accessibility as a separate kind of process from the core development. It really needs to be integrated at every single stage. We did do a lot, as Matias did a big long post on it. We&#8217;ve done a ton of keyboard accessibility stuff, there&#8217;s ARIA elements on everything. One of their feedbacks was that we did it wrong, but we did it the best that we knew how to and it&#8217;s been in there for awhile. There&#8217;s been over 200 closed issues from really the very beginning. We also took the opportunity to fix some things that had been poorly accessible in WordPress from the beginning. It&#8217;s not that WordPress is perfectly accessible and all WCAG AA and it&#8217;s reverting. It&#8217;s actually that huge swaths of WP are inaccessible &#8211; they just might not be considered core paths from the current accessibility team but I consider them core.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In response to a question about the future of React in WordPress, Mullenweg went more in depth on the vision he had when he urged the WordPress community to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress\">learn JavaScript deeply in 2015</a>. At that time he said &#8220;it is the future of the web.&#8221; He described how each block can be a launching point for something else &#8211; via a modal, such as updating settings, doing advanced things with an e-commerce store, zooming in and out of those screens from the editor. This was perhaps the most inspirational part of the Q&amp;A where the potential of Gutenberg shines as bright as it did in the early demos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The other beautiful thing is that because Gutenberg essentially allows for translation into many different formats,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It can publish to your web page, your RSS feed, AMP, blocks can be translated into email for newsletters, there&#8217;s so much that the structured nature of Gutenberg and the semantic HTML it creates and the grammar that&#8217;s used to parse it, can enable for other applications. It becomes a little bit like a lingua franca that perhaps even crosses CMS&#8217;s. There&#8217;s now these new cross-CMS Gutenberg blocks will be possible. It&#8217;s not just WordPress anymore. It may be a JavaScript block that was written for Drupal that you install on your WordPress site. I mean, hot diggity! How would that have ever happened before? That&#8217;s why we took two years off; it&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve had everyone in the world working on this thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>JavaScript is what makes this cross-platform collaboration possible and it&#8217;s already evident in the work the Drupal Gutenberg contributors are doing, as well as the platform-agnostic Gutenberg Cloud project. When Gutenberg is released in 5.0, it will enable more for WordPress and the web than we can predict right now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is not the finish line,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;5.0 is almost like the starting point. Expect just as much time invested into Gutenberg after the 5.0 release as before &#8211; to get it to that place where we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just better than what we have today but it&#8217;s actually like a world-class web-defining experience, which is what we want to create and what you all deserve.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 10 Nov 2018 15:30:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.0 Release Date Update to November 27\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85475\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-release-date-update-to-november-27\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2548:\"<p>The WordPress 5.0 release date has been pushed back to November 27.

There is still a chance that the release could be delayed to the secondary date (January 22, 2019), but the decision has not yet been announced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am lukewarm on the 19th, but not because of the number of open issues (which isn&#8217;t a good measure or target) — more that we&#8217;ve been a day or two behind a few times now,&#8221; 5.0 release lead Matt Mullenweg said during yesterday&#8217;s dev chat. He said that reports &#8220;from the field&#8221; continue to be good and companies that have already installed and activated the plugin haven&#8217;t reported a higher than normal support burden.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My concern can be summed up as this,&#8221; Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;There are approximately 400 issues that need either code or a decision to punt. Assuming five minutes per issue, that means there are about 33 hours worth of bug scrubs that need to take place between now and RC.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t think we can make a decision on moving the date in the next 45 minutes,&#8221; Gary Pendergast said in response to concerns raised at the meeting. &#8220;I do think it’s fair to say that the Gutenberg and 5.0 leadership teams are hearing all the feedback, and are actively looking whether the timeline is still correct.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said open issues are not a good measure of whether the release is on target but the numerous bugs the community is encountering has precipitated a flurry of posts advocating for the release to be delayed.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://joost.blog/wordpress-5-0-needs-a-different-timeline/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 5.0 needs a different timeline</a>,&#8221; Joost de Valk, author of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO</a>, cites accessibility concerns and the stability of the project as reasons for a delay. de Valk identifies himself a strong supporter of Gutenberg and his team has already built compatibility and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-8-2-adds-how-to-and-faq-gutenberg-blocks-with-structured-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg-first features</a> into their plugin, which has more than 5 million active installs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s arguably one of the biggest leaps forward in WordPress’ editing experience and its developer experience in this decade,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;It’s also not done yet, and if we keep striving for its planned November 19th release date, we are setting ourselves up for failure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>de Valk gave two reasons for why he believes the November 19th timeline to be untenable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are some <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2018/10/29/report-on-the-accessibility-status-of-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">severe accessibility concerns</a>. While these aren’t new and a few people are working hard on them, I actually think we can get a better handle on fixing them if we push the release back. Right now it looks to me as though keyboard accessibility has regressed in the last few releases of Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>The most important reason: the overall stability of the project isn’t where it needs to be yet. There are so many open issues for the 5.0 milestone that even fixing all the blockers before we’d get to Release Candidate stage next week is going to prove impossible. We have, at time of writing <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Amilestone+label%3A%22%5BType%5D+Bug%22+-label%3A%22future%22+\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">212 untriaged bugs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22WordPress+5.0%22\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">165 issues on the WordPress 5.0 milestone</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress developer Mark Root-Wiley published a post the same day titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://mrwweb.com/wordpress-5-0-is-not-ready/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 5.0 is Not Ready</a>.&#8221; He outlined why he believes the release needs to be delayed and suggested the project pursue more auditing and quality assurance testing before shipping it out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress 5.0 can and should be a positive change to WordPress, but if it is released in late November as planned, it won’t be,&#8221; Root-Wiley said. &#8220;There are simply too many bugs in the editor, and the experience is not polished enough. This is because the rate of development has prevented systematic quality assurance (QA) and user testing. Both types of testing are required to ensure the editor is ready and to increase the community’s confidence in the update.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Root-Wiley describes a buggy experience when attempting to write blog posts with the new editor, which echoes many others&#8217; <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1060255182552854528\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">experiences</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m doing my best to give feedback, but it’s exhausting and there are so many little bugs that I struggle to isolate and replicate the one I’m reporting without running into another,&#8221; Root-Wiley said. &#8220;How is it possible for me to find so many bugs without trying from just writing 1.5 blog posts?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Root-Wiley also suggested removing what he deemed to be unnecessary features in order to streamline the editing experience and focus on the fundamentals. These features include the tables block, paragraph background colors, spotlight and fullscreen mode, dropcaps, verse block, among others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The pace of development has been blistering,&#8221; Root-Wiley said. &#8220;That speed has been great for developing a lot of features and iterating on those features quickly, but it hasn’t allowed for sufficient testing. What’s needed now is more time for people to find and report bugs with the editor features in their proposed final state.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg criticism is often characterized as coming from people who are resistant to change, but these strong messages about delaying the release come from developers who believe the new editor is the future and have heavily invested in contributing to its success.</p>\n<p>Both de Valk and Root-Wiley&#8217;s posts seem to have resonated with many who have had similar experiences with the editor. Other core developers and committers have also publicly lent their voices to the call to delay the release.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My thoughts are very much aligned here.

Those who are working on it full-time have not publicly offered opinions indicating that it might not be ready for the November 19 timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The 5.0 milestone is in a very manageable place, but if the volume becomes more worrying in the next couple days or it becomes clear milestones won’t be made, we’ll revise as needed,&#8221; Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura Ventura said during yesterday&#8217;s dev chat. He confirmed that the fast pace of development will continue.</p>\n<p>Regardless of when 5.0 is released, users can count on getting minor releases every two weeks to address bugs and issues that pop up after Gutenberg is in the hands of millions more users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hopefully as people get used to the more regular cadence they can plan around it, much like they used to complain a ton about, but then got used to, 3 major releases a year,&#8221; Mullenweg said during the dev chat.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Mullenweg began describing how WordPress could become &#8220;the operating system of the web,&#8221; with open APIs that others can build on. While that idea encompasses a lot more than just release schedules, WordPress seems to be moving in the direction of shipping updates that come more frequently and eventually more invisibly in the background, similar to how users update their browsers. Releasing Gutenberg in its current state, with frequent updates following, could prove to be a major testing ground to see if greater world of WordPress users are ready to embrace this new era of rapid iteration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 00:03:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Adding Aligned Images to Paragraphs in Gutenberg Is Not as Tough as I Thought\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85417\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/adding-aligned-images-to-paragraphs-in-gutenberg-is-not-as-tough-as-i-thought\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4126:\"Last week, I published <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-add-an-image-to-a-paragraph-block-in-gutenberg\">an article</a> that describes the process I went through in Gutenberg to try to add an aligned image to a paragraph block. I concluded that performing the task in the Classic Editor was easier than in Gutenberg.\n\n\n\nIn response to the article, William Earnhardt <a href=\"https://wearnhardt.com/2018/11/the-gutenberg-complexity-fallacy/\">compared the process</a> and showed how it can be accomplished in two steps in Gutenberg.\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Drag an image into editor where you want it to go. </li><li>Click align right. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n\nDragging and dropping images into WordPress is not something I do. It&#8217;s not how I write. His method is simpler but I prefer to work within the interface. His second suggestion of accomplishing the task is the method I&#8217;ll use from now on.\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Click the block inserter above the paragraph you want to insert the image before.</li><li>Select the image block.</li><li>Drag the image onto the block.</li><li>Click align right.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\nIn the last few months of using Gutenberg, I&#8217;ve become accustomed to adding new blocks by pressing enter at the end of a paragraph block or by clicking the plus sign to the left of a block. I haven&#8217;t used the plus sign between blocks but it makes sense and indeed, it&#8217;s quicker to accomplish the task.\n\n\n\nAccording to Earnhardt, there are even more ways to complete the task in Gutenberg. This brings up an important question, how many different ways and user interfaces should there be to accomplish a task? If you don&#8217;t do it a certain way, are you <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/_doing_it_wrong/\">doing_it_wrong</a>?\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n\nTake for example, adding captions to images. In Gutenberg, there are at least two opportunities to add a caption. The first is the attachment details screen after uploading or selecting an image from the media library.\n\n\n\nThe second is the Image block user interface. When using the Image block interface, my cursor gets stuck in the caption area and I need to click outside of the block in order to continue. If I use the attachment details screen, it automatically puts the caption text into the image block, bypassing the hurdle. Which interface am I supposed to use and which method is considered doing_it_wrong?<br />\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018-11-08_00-56-29-1.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Adding a Caption via the Image Block Interface</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>I&#8217;m Willing to Learn</h2>\n\n\n\n\nI understand the long vision of Gutenberg and what it means for the future of WordPress. For the past several months, I&#8217;ve used the plugin and interface exclusively to craft content.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;ve been learning things along the way and trying to readjust my workflows but the question I keep coming back to when doing things in Gutenberg is why?\n\n\n\nWhy is this button hidden? Why are there three differently located buttons to add blocks when it would be nice to memorize one? Why does this do that and vice versa? Where is all of the research and usability testing that explains the why behind so many of the interactions and flows? Am I just a moron or is it the interface that guides me in the wrong direction?\n\n\n\nMany of my experiences in using Gutenberg this past year have been <a href=\"https://mrwweb.com/wordpress-5-0-is-not-ready/\">echoed by Mark Root-Wiley</a>. He does a great job of saying what I&#8217;ve been feeling and thinking for a long time.\n\n\n\nWhen I and thousands of others watched Matías Ventura‏ perform a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOY3ZUO6P0k&feature=youtu.be\">live demo</a> of Gutenberg at the 2017 State of Word, people were blown away. But this is someone who has been creating Gutenberg from the core and is proficient in all that it offers. Is this the level of Gutenberg proficiency I and others need in order to get things done? Probably not, but at times, it sure feels that way. <br />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 07:37:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Classic Editor Plugin May Be Included with 5.0 Updates, Support Window Set to End in 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85387\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/classic-editor-plugin-may-be-included-with-5-0-updates-support-window-set-to-end-in-2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6806:\"<p>Gary Pendergast <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> this morning that the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin will be officially supported until December 31, 2021. The plugin eases the transition for sites where plugins or themes are not yet compatible with Gutenberg and gives users the opportunity to preserve their existing workflows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since the Classic Editor plugin is central in this transition, we are considering including it with upgrades to WordPress 5.0,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;New WordPress installs would still add it manually, and we’ve included it in the Featured Plugins list to increase visibility. If you have thoughts on this idea, please leave a comment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast clarified that &#8220;officially supported&#8221; means that the plugin &#8220;will be guaranteed to work as expected in the most recent major release of WordPress, and the major release before it.&#8221; He also said the project will evaluate the continuing maintenance of the plugin in 2021 and may possibly extend the date.</p>\n<p>The post has already received quite a bit of feedback and generally positive reactions to the prospect of including the Classic Editor along with 5.0 updates for existing sites.</p>\n<p>WordPress Core Committer Pascal Birchler asked for a clarification on what &#8220;we&#8221; referred to in Pendergast&#8217;s post, and Pendergast clarified that he is speaking on behalf of the WordPress project. Other commenters pressed for more information, as the announcement was delivered as something that had already been decided and the conversation surrounding the decision was not public.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m grateful for the communication on a hard date for support of the classic editor,&#8221; Darren Ethier commented on the post. &#8220;It helps many people depending on WordPress for their livelihood to make plans surrounding things depending on it. But for volunteers who &#8216;show up&#8217; at meetings and in contributing, the process for arriving at these kinds of decisions in an open source project is very opaque and seems to be increasingly so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This announcement highlights a trend in recent decision making for the project where decisions on important items appear to have been made behind closed doors without community input. Matthew MacPherson&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-accessibility-audit-postponed-indefinitely\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal for an independent accessibility audit</a>, which had broad support from the community, was shut down in a similar way. MacPherson was named WordPress 5.0&#8217;s accessibility lead but didn&#8217;t seem to be fully vested with the power to lead that aspect of the release in the community&#8217;s best interests. I asked MacPherson if he could further clarify how the decision to forego the audit was reached, as it seemed even a surprise to him in the GitHub issue thread. He said he had &#8220;no comment&#8221; on how the decision came about.</p>\n<p>WPCampus is now <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-is-pursuing-an-independent-accessibility-audit-of-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pursuing an accessibility audit</a> in order to better serve its community of more than 800 web professionals, educators, and others who work with WordPress in higher education.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re receiving a lot of interest and I&#8217;m holding meetings with potential vendors to answer their questions,&#8221; WPCampus director Rachel Cherry said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve received a lot of messages from individuals and organizations wanting to contribute financially.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-delivers-sobering-assessment-of-gutenberg-we-have-to-draw-a-line\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent report from the accessibility team</a> demonstrates critical issues that prevent the team from recommending Gutenberg to users of assistive technology. These issues also have a major impact on those using WordPress for higher education, as the law requires them to meet certain standards. Several in this particular industry commented on Pendergast&#8217;s post to advocate for shipping the Classic Editor plugin with new installs as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many organizations who use WordPress are required by law to provide accessible software under Section 508,&#8221; Rachel Cherry said. &#8220;Until such a time when the accessibility of Gutenberg has been improved, and Section 508 compliance is clear, these organizations will require use of the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not to mention the users who will be dependent upon the Classic Editor to have an accessible publishing experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please consider bundling Classic Editor with all versions of core, new and updated, going forward so that every end user has the easy and inclusive option of using it from day one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Elaine Shannon, another WordPress user who works in academia, also commented on the Pendergast&#8217;s post to recommend having the Classic Editor bundled with new versions of WordPress, due to many education sites running on multisite installations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some institutions are on managed hosts, where they’ll receive 5.0 without initiating the update themselves,&#8221; Shannon said. &#8220;Others are managed by on-campus IT services, where one campus admin will push the update and affect thousands of users. In many cases, these are MultiSites where end users – the ones who need the choice of whether to use Gutenberg or Classic Editor – do not have the ability to add a plugin. So regardless of whether these users are in a brand-new shiny install or just an updated existing one, many users are going to need to fall back to the Classic Editor, and if it’s not bundled with Core there will be some folks left having to contact their administrator.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast&#8217;s post said the WordPress project is considering including the plugin with upgrades to 5.0 but did not identify where or when that decision will be made.

That\'s a world I\'m excited to see.\" /><p>I never meant to become an activist. I swear. It was an accident.</p>\n<p>And yet here I am, celebrating my one year anniversary of leading the Diversity Outreach Speaker Training working group in the WordPress Community team. We are causing waves in the number of women and other underrepresented groups who are stepping up to become speakers at WordPress Meetups, WordCamps, and events. Pretty cool, right?</p>\n<p>How did this happen?</p>\n<p>Let’s start this story with how I got into WordPress. Back in 2011, I was looking for a practicum placement for the New Media Design and Web Development college program I was in in Vancouver, BC. We had touched on WordPress only briefly in class. I was curious about it, so I got a Practicum placement working on a higher education website that was built in WordPress. (It was in BuddyPress, even! Ooh. Aah.) As a thank you, my practicum advisor bought me a ticket to WordCamp Vancouver 2011: Developer’s Edition. That event was the start of my love affair with WordPress and I began taking on freelancing gigs. I’ve been a WordPress solopreneur for most of the time since.</p>\n<p>The following year my practicum advisor, who had become a client, was creating the first ever BuddyCamp for BuddyPress. He asked me to be on his organizing team. (Side note: I was especially excited to moderate a panel with Matt Mullenweg and other big names on it!) I was noticed and I was invited to be on the core organizing team for the next year’s WordCamp Vancouver by the lead organizer. I was thrilled. It was quite an honour!</p>\n<p>This is where the real story begins… after an important disclaimer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Disclaimer: For simplicity in this story, I’ll be using the terms women and men, though in reality gender is not a simple binary and is actually a wide spectrum of different identities.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>The Real Beginning</h3>\n<p>There were three of us—myself and two men—and it was our first time any of us were organizing a WordCamp. We were having dinner in one of our apartments and we had 40 speaker applications spread out before us. The plan was to pick 14 to speak. It was hard. They were all really good.</p>\n<p>The lead organizer grabbed 6 out of the 7 that came from the women and said, &#8220;Well, we are accepting all of these.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At this point I didn’t know that not many women were applying to speak at tech conferences at the time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I was the one saying, &#8220;Wait, wait. Who cares what gender they are? Let’s go through them and pick based on the topics that would fit the conference’s flow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>They both said that the 6 of the women’s pitches were really good, fit with the flow, and frankly, we needed to accept as many as we could or we’d get called out. (This is embarrassing to say now, but that was the conversation back in 2013.)</p>\n<p>Here’s how it went down:</p>\n<p>After we accepted the six, two of the women dropped out for family emergencies. (Guess how many men dropped out for family emergencies?) Also we had added a third speakers’ track. Now there were only 4 women out of 28 speakers. Only 1 in 7. That is 14%, my friends. That is not great.</p>\n<p>So not great, in fact, that we did get called out. People did talk about it, question us about it, and even wrote blog posts about it.</p>\n<h3>More Experience</h3>\n<p>So when later that year I went to WordCamp San Francisco—the biggest WordCamp at the time (before there was a WordCamp US)—I took the opportunity to chat with other organizers at a WordCamp organizer brunch.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I found out that many of the organizers had trouble getting enough women presenters.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was surprised to find that we actually had a high number of women applicants in comparison to others, as many of them had zero! They were asking me how we got such a high number. They all said they would happily accept more if only more would apply.</p>\n<p>So then I needed to know, why was this happening? Why weren’t we getting more women applicants? I started researching, reading, and talking to people.</p>\n<p>Though this issue is complex, one thing that came up over and over was that when we would ask the question, &#8220;Hey, will you speak at my conference?&#8221; we would get two answers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;What would I talk about?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;I’m not an expert on anything. I don’t know enough about anything to give a talk on it.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s when the idea happened.</p>\n<h3>The Idea</h3>\n<p>As it goes, the idea happened while I was at a feminist blanket-fort slumber party. Yes, you heard right. And as one does at all feminist blanket-fort slumber parties, we talked about feminist issues.</p>\n<p>When I brought up my issue about the responses we were getting, one of the ladies said, &#8220;Why don’t you get them in a room and have them brainstorm topics?&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>And that was it. That set me on the path.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I became the lead of a small group creating a workshop in Vancouver. In one of the exercises, we invited the participants to brainstorm ideas and show them that they have literally a hundred ideas. (Then the biggest problem becomes picking one. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> )</p>\n<p>In our first iteration, we covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why it matters that women (<em>added later: diverse groups</em>) are in the front of the room</li>\n<li>The myths of what it takes to be the speaker at the front of the room (aka beating impostor syndrome)</li>\n<li>Different speaking formats, especially story-telling</li>\n<li>Finding and refining a topic</li>\n<li>Tips to becoming a better speaker</li>\n<li>Practising leveling up speaking in front of the group throughout the afternoon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other cities across North America got wind of our workshop and started running it as well, and they added their own material.</p>\n<p>Our own participants wanted more support, so the next year we added material created from the other cities as well as generated more of our own:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coming up with a great title</li>\n<li>Writing a pitch that is more likely to get accepted</li>\n<li>Writing a bio</li>\n<li>Creating an outline</li>\n<li>Creating better slides</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We did it! In 2014—in only one year since we started—we had 50% women speakers and 3 times the number of women applicants! Not only that, but it was a Developer’s Edition. It&#8217;s more challenging it is to find women developers in general, let alone those who will step up to speak.</p>\n<h3>Building On</h3>\n<p>Impressive as that is, the reason I am truly passionate about this work is because of what happened next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the women who did our workshop and started publicly speaking stepped up to be leaders in our community and created new things for us. For example, a couple of them created a new Meetup track with a User focus.</li>\n<li>A handful of others became WordCamp organizers. One year Vancouver had an almost all-female organizing team – 5 out of 6!</li>\n<li>It also influenced local businesses. One local business owner loved what one of the women speakers said so much that he hired her immediately. She was the first woman developer on the team, and soon after she became the Senior Developer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is results like these that ignited my passion. I’ve now seen time and again what happens when different kinds of folks speak in the front of the room. More kinds of people feel welcome in the community. The speakers and the new community members bring new ideas and new passions that help to make the technology we are creating more inclusive as well as generate new ideas that benefit everyone.</p>\n<p>This workshop has been so successful, with typical results of 40-60% women speakers at WordCamps, that the WordPress Community Team asked me to promote it and train it for women and all diverse groups around the world. We created the Diversity Outreach Speaker Training working group. I started creating and leading it in late 2017.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thanks to our group, our workshop has been run in 17 cities so far this year, 32 have been trained to run it, and 53 have expressed interest in 24 countries. Incredible!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love this work so much that I’m now looking at how to do this for a living. I’m proud of how the human diversity represented on the stage adds value not only to the brand but also in the long-term will lead to the creation of a better product. I’m inspired by seeing the communities change as a result of the new voices and new ideas at the WordPress events.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Jill’s leadership in the development and growth of the Diversity Outreach Speaker Training initiative has had a positive, measurable impact on WordPress community events worldwide.

The theme was first released in May 2017 and has more than 100,000 active installations. It was downloaded approximately 2,000 &#8211; 4,500 times per day over the past month and currently maintains a 5-star average rating on WordPress.org after 844 reviews.</p>\n<p>Astra&#8217;s creators advertise the theme as fast, lightweight (less than 50KB on frontend), and compatible with many page builders. These features have been key to its rapid growth. Last week they announced full Gutenberg compatibility, which means sites built with Astra will be able to take advantage of all the new features in the editor when 5.0 is released.  </p>\n<p>Astra&#8217;s Gutenberg compatibility update includes front-end styles displayed in the editor and support for the full-width alignment option. The width of the content in the editor matches that of the frontend, and the same is true for the typography, colors, and background.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gutenberg-full-width.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The theme also ensures that the default Gutenberg blocks, i.e. quotes and galleries, will inherit Astra customizer styles to match the rest of the site. </p>\n<p>Astra&#8217;s creators support the theme by offering commercial <a href=\"https://wpastra.com/pricing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">packages</a> that include additional features and plugins, <a href=\"https://wpastra.com/ready-websites/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">starter sites</a>, add-ons for page builders, and support. They plan to offer additional Gutenberg features in commercial add-ons. Astra&#8217;s Ultimate Addons product will introduce custom blocks, such as Section, Heading, Info Box, Post Grid, Google Map, Table, Social Share, Menu, Buttons, along with pre-made starter templates.</p>\n<p>After two months of weekend work, Anders Norén reported that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/anlino/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">all 18 of his free themes on WordPress.org</a> have been <a href=\"http://www.andersnoren.se/the-gutenberg-update/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated to be compatible with Gutenberg</a>. Norén&#8217;s popular minimalist style themes have a cumulative rating of 4.97 out of 5 stars and have been downloaded more than <a href=\"http://wptally.com/?wpusername=anlino\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2.2 million times</a>. They are active on an estimated 100,000 WordPress installations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are no custom blocks or other fancy stuff to be found in the updates, but if you’re running one of my themes, you should be able to update to WordPress 5.0 and start using Gutenberg without any hitches, in the editor or on the front-end,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;If you plan to keep using the classic editor, things should look mostly the same after you install the update.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg compatibility update for Norén&#8217;s themes includes editor styles, with layout, typography and colors matching the theme, styles for core blocks and new alignment options, and custom font sizes and color palette in the editor. Norén also took the opportunity to do an overall code cleanup and add improvements for older versions of PHP, accessibility and localization improvements, and bug fixes, amounting to 17,525 lines of code added or modified.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The past couple of weekends have been grueling, but knowing that my themes will be ready for WordPress 5.0 – whether it hits the November 20th release date or not – was worth it,&#8221; Norén said.</p>\n<p>Themeisle has updated <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hestia</a> with Gutenberg compatibility in the theme&#8217;s <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/blog/hestia-2-0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2.0 release</a>. The popular Material Design WordPress theme is the company&#8217;s flagship product and is installed on more than 100,000 WordPress sites. The company is planning to release a brand new theme that will be fully Gutenberg compatible. They have not yet announced if <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/zerif-lite/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zerif Lite</a> (100,000+ installs) will be updated for the new editor.</p>\n<p>Six weeks ago, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/search/Gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">searching the WordPress.org Theme Directory for “Gutenberg”</a> produced 26 results where compatibility is mentioned in the theme descriptions. That number has jumped to 53. Support for the new editor seems to have happened much faster in the commercial theme space where <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress?term=Gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">searching for Gutenberg on Envato</a> already turns up hundreds of results before the editor has even landed in core. Authors of free themes on WordPress.org don&#8217;t always have the same motivation. Those who support popular themes are more likely to have their themes compatible by the time WordPress 5.0 arrives, especially if the free theme is connected to a paid product.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 04:34:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.0 Beta 3 Released, RC 1 Expected November 12\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85224\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-beta-3-released-rc-1-expected-november-12\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6909:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/11/wordpress-5-0-beta-3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 5.0 Beta 3</a> was released this morning. This beta incorporates all the changes from <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/31/whats-new-in-gutenberg-31st-october-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 4.2 RC1</a>, which was released last week. It fixes a bug with the display of the custom fields meta box and also improves REST API requests.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg has undergone a few UI tweaks and introduces a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10209\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Formatting API</a> for adding new RichText components. The inserter between blocks was updated to provide a more consistent experience that matches the other “add block” buttons. Version 4.2 also adds support for displaying icons in new block categories to better organize groups of blocks. The example pictured in the release post shows the Jetpack icon. The Jetpack team has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-6-6-improves-site-verification-tools-asset-cdn-module-now-in-beta-gutenberg-blocks-coming-soon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">working on a number of blocks for existing features</a> and is expected to release those soon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/block-categories.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 Beta 3 brings in updates from Twenty Nineteen&#8217;s GitHub repository, including support for selective refresh widgets in the customizer, support for responsive embeds, and tweaks to improve the experience on mobile devices.</p>\n<h3>Updates to WordPress 5.0 Schedule: More Beta Releases and a Shortened RC Period</h3>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 is now two weeks away from its <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">projected release date</a> of November 19. Last week Gary Pendergast announced some <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/31/wordpress-5-0-schedule-updates/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updates to the 5.0 release schedule</a> that build in extra time for betas. After pushing out Beta 3 Pendergast said he expects to release Beta 4 later this week. He also offered an explanation for why RC1 is scheduled for release on November 12, allowing for just one week of last-minute testing following RC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The block editor has been available for over a year,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;It’s already had a longer testing period, with 30 times the number of sites using it, than any previous WordPress release. The primary purpose of the beta and release candidate periods is to ensure that it’s been correctly merged into Core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Initial feedback on the schedule changes indicate that some user would appreciate a longer RC period, since the code being tested has changed so often. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The API freeze just happened in version 4.2, so saying the editor has been available for over a year in anywhere near its current state doesn’t make sense for a 7-day RC period on such a major change,&#8221; WordPress trainer and developer Brian Hogg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/31/wordpress-5-0-schedule-updates/#comment-34292\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As an example, just in the last version or two the hover-over menu to remove a block has been taken out and tucked away at the top menu (which was available as shown in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yjqW_IS6Q7w?t=80\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/yjqW_IS6Q7w?t=80</a>), with little time for anyone to provide usability feedback on changes like this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who are creating training materials and videos have been waiting for a bit of a reprieve in Gutenberg development to make sure their materials are accurate and ready for 5.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Knowing it’s an RC means we can assume a level of &#8216;this is how it will be&#8217; that just isn’t necessarily with pre-RC versions,&#8221; Modern Tribe developer George Gecewicz <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/31/wordpress-5-0-schedule-updates/#comment-34278\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the post. &#8220;That relative certainty is useful for testing aggressively, finalizing design/UI stuff, and revealing post-merge bugs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 4.1 was supposed to be the &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/milestone/66\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UI freeze</a>&#8221; milestone, but that hasn&#8217;t happened yet with several changes introduced in 4.2. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The \"freeze\" in \"UI freeze\" doesn\'t mean you can thaw it and change it willy nilly. Some of us rely on such landmarks to do our work.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Morten Rand-Hendriksen (@mor10) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1059269623944642560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>There should be short window of time before 5.0 is released where training materials can be finalized. However, the Gutenberg team plans to continue on from there with its same pace of development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the past six months, there has been a release every two weeks,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;We’ll plan to continue that over the first few WordPress 5.0.x releases, to ensure that bug fixes are available as quickly as possible. How soon should we expect WordPress 5.0.1? Approximately two weeks after WordPress 5.0, unless we see bug reports that indicate a need for a faster release.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 is on schedule for its original release date, but there is still a possibility for the the release to be delayed. Matt Mullenweg, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-delivers-sobering-assessment-of-gutenberg-we-have-to-draw-a-line#comment-266997\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commenting</a> on responses to the accessibility team&#8217;s assessment of Gutenberg, said that delaying the release has &#8220;definitely been considered&#8221; and that it may still happen. His response also indicates that WordPress users can expect the pace of core development to continue along the path Gutenberg has carved. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Despite some differences that still need be resolved, there’s general consensus that the long-term way to create the best WP experience for all types of users is not something you can tack on with 5-6 weeks at the end, but will be the result of continuing the continuous iteration we’ve had with the 42 public releases of Gutenberg so far,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It means we can get improvements into the hands of users within weeks following a release, not months (or years) as was the old model with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Nov 2018 18:39:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.0 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6236\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/11/wordpress-5-0-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3164:\"<p>WordPress 5.0 Beta 3 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

It&#8217;s taken a lot of courage and bravery for him to do that. He&#8217;s taken a lot of shots in the back, but you know that&#8217;s why he gets paid the big bucks as they say.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Stories Discussed:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jjj.blog/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-1/\">WordPress 5.0 Beta 1</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-delivers-sobering-assessment-of-gutenberg-we-have-to-draw-a-line\">WordPress Accessibility Team Delivers Sobering Assessment of Gutenberg: “We have to draw a line.”</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-5-introduces-rest-api-v3-improves-transactional-emails\">WooCommerce 3.5 Introduces REST API v3, Improves Transactional Emails</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-array-themes\">WP Engine Acquires Array Themes</a></p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, November 7th 3:00 P.M.

This user wants the image to be aligned to the right. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accomplishing the Task in the Classic Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The classic editor is essentially one big block. Adding media to a paragraph is as quick as placing the mouse cursor at the beginning of a paragraph, clicking the add new media button, selecting or uploading an image, and choosing its alignment. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"mce_6\">Accomplishing the Task in Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Gutenberg, each paragraph is a block and each block has its own toolbar. This is important because after writing three paragraphs, you can&#8217;t click on an add media button. Instead, you need to create an image block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve selected an image, you need to move the image block above the paragraph block where you want to insert it. At first, you might try to drag and drop the image into the paragraph but that doesn&#8217;t work. You need to use the up and down arrows or drag the block into position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the image block is in the correct location, click the align right icon. The image will be inserted into the right side of the paragraph block. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />A Right Aligned Image Inside of A Paragraph Block\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to move the image to a different paragraph block, you&#8217;ll need to click the Align center button which turns the image back into its own block and repeat the process described above. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adding Images to Paragraphs in the Classic Editor Is Easier<br /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The task I described above is one I think millions of users will have trouble completing when WordPress 5.0 is released. In the Classic editor, the writing flow doesn&#8217;t feel disjointed when you want to add images or embed content into posts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Gutenberg, everything is a block which in many cases, causes the flow to be disrupted as you need to figure out what block you need, how to manipulate it, where to move it, find where the options are, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of adding images to paragraphs will likely improve after WordPress 5.0 is released but until then, the Classic editor wins this use case. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 11:35:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: Google’s reCAPTCHA v3 Promises a “Frictionless User Experience”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85145\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/googles-recaptcha-v3-promises-a-frictionless-user-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3218:\"<p>Google <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/10/introducing-recaptcha-v3-new-way-to.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introduced reCAPTCHA v3</a> this week, which promises a new &#8220;frictionless user experience.&#8221; Earlier versions of the API stopped bots but also drew the ire of internet users across the globe. Users were regularly inconvenienced with distorted text challenges, street sign puzzles, click requirements, and other actions to prove their humanity. </p>\n<p>v3 offers a marked improvement by detecting bots in the background and returning a score that tells the admin if the interaction is suspicious. It scores traffic with its <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110054961A1/en\">Adaptive Risk Analysis Engine</a> instead of forcing human users to perform interactive challenges. The score can be used three different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a threshold that determines when a user is let through or when further verification needs to be done, i.e. two-factor authentication or phone verification.</li>\n<li>Combine the score with your own signals that reCAPTCHA can’t access, such as user profiles or transaction histories.</li>\n<li>Use the reCAPTCHA score as one of the signals to train your machine learning model to fight abuse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>v3 give site owners more options to customize the thresholds and actions for different types of traffic. The video below explains how it works and the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">developer docs</a> have more information on frontend integration and score interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Site owners can view their traffic in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reCAPTCHA admin console</a>. It also displays a list of all of your sites and what version of the API they are using.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-11-01-at-5.08.11-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The admin console also has a form for registering new sites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-11-01-at-5.09.18-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The WordPress Plugin Directory has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/reCAPTCHA/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of standalone plugins and contact forms</a> that make use of reCAPTCHA in some way. Sites that are already set up to use v2 or the Invisible CAPTCHA, will not automatically update to use v3. There&#8217;s a different signup and implementation process that the site owner has to perform before having it integrated on the site.</p>\n<p>WordPress plugin developers who offer reCAPTCHA will have to decide if they want to update existing plugins to use v3 or package a v3 offering in a new plugin. The reCAPTCHA v1 API was shut down earlier this year in March. Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/google/recaptcha/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reCAPTCHA PHP client library on GitHub</a> is still actively encouraging use of both v2 and v3.

The blocks are hosted on NPM and their assets are served from CloudFlare using <a href=\"https://unpkg.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unpkg.com</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gutenberg-cloud-wp-plugin.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg Cloud&#8217;s online library of blocks is CMS agnostic, offering blocks for both Drupal and WordPress sites, and more CMSs in the future. The service advertises three key benefits for developers who host blocks on Gutenberg Cloud:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wider adoption: Your blocks can be used outside of WP</li>\n<li>Discoverability: Your blocks will pop up in the Cloud Blocks UI</li>\n<li>Faster development: No plugin/SVN needed, just publish to NPM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Frontkom is actively recruiting WordPress developers to add blocks to the cloud to test the process. Documentation for <a href=\"https://github.com/front/cloud-blocks/blob/master/docs/migrate-block.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">migrating blocks from a plugin</a> is available on GitHub. Frontkom has also produced a new <a href=\"https://github.com/front/create-cloud-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">boilerplate generator for building Gutenberg Cloud blocks</a>.</p>\n<p>Users should note that the team is still ironing out the experience for developers adding blocks to the cloud, so the plugin isn&#8217;t yet ready for general use. It&#8217;s currently under active development. </p>\n<h3>WordPress Developers Say Gutenberg Cloud May Not be the Best Way to Release Blocks but Platform has Potential</h3>\n<p>I contacted some WordPress developers who have tested sending their blocks to Gutenberg Cloud to get their initial reactions to the platform. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea that folks will be able to install blocks a la carte is interesting,&#8221; <a href=\"https://coblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> author and ThemeBeans founder Rich Tabor said. &#8220;It’s pretty much as easy as installing plugins.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor experimented with migrating his Block Gallery blocks and said the process was not difficult but he foresees difficulties in maintaining blocks across parent plugins and Gutenberg Cloud.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a developer, I’m still not entirely convinced Gutenberg Cloud is the best way to release blocks, aside from relatively simple blocks,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;I personally lean towards building suites of blocks that share a relative purpose, instead of one plugin (or one Cloud Block instance) per block. For one, it cuts down on maintenance quite a bit, as custom components can be shared between blocks. And there’s much better discoverability on getting relative blocks in the hands of users — if they’re grouped together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Block collections have been criticized for making it difficult to search for and discover individual blocks, but Tabor makes some good arguments for improving block discoverability by grouping together features users often need. That is the whole point of successful plugins like Jetpack, but this type of packaging also lends itself to criticism about bloat.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a similar conundrum when we look at grouped/not grouped shortcode plugins,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;I suppose the main difference is that the nature of blocks is much more complicated than that of shortcodes. History seems to repeat itself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he is considering distributing a few of his free blocks through Gutenberg Cloud but he hasn&#8217;t fully decided yet.</p>\n<p>WordPress core contributor, <a href=\"https://joshpress.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Pollock</a>, who has worked extensively with React and Gutenberg, also tested the Gutenberg Cloud platform. He said he thinks it has a lot of potential for developers who write blocks that are mainly JavaScript already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could see how an agency that builds WordPress sites could save a lot of time and hassle building out a block library,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;As a plugin developer with a lot of little ideas, the pain and time of setting up a block and block environment, which no one has gotten right yet, makes me very excited about this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pollock also reported a positive experience with the <a href=\"https://github.com/front/create-cloud-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create-cloud-block</a> generator.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The code that create-cloud-block generates is well-written, but not too opinionated,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;The developer experience is both really cool &#8212; you preview your block in a functional Gutenberg-powered editor with no WordPress site attached &#8212; and a little frustrating as there is no live reload yet. I know they are just getting started and the tool doesn&#8217;t lock you into any structure, which is great. I&#8217;ll be keeping my eye on this project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom CTO Per André Rønsen said his team will continue testing the cloud internally until they get more developer feedback on the corresponding WordPress plugin. For Drupal users, Gutenberg Cloud will be shipped as a submodule of Gutenberg, which means all sites that install Gutenberg will also get the Cloud module. It can, however, be disabled. Rønsen said his team plans to showcase Gutenberg Cloud for D8 at DrupalCamp Oslo in November.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 23:12:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Matt: What’s in My Bag, 2018 Edition\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48557\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://ma.tt/2018/10/whats-in-my-bag-2018-edition/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12451:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2018/10/bag-v4.jpg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://sdrtraveller.com/collections/accessories/products/travel-folio\">SDR Kashmir Travel Folio</a>, made with this super-cool material called Dyneema, which is twice as strong as Kevlar and 15 times as strong as steel, but virtually weightless.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XGD6CS4/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Garmin Forerunner 935</a> which is a triathlon watch, so it can tell me how much I don’t run, how much I don’t bike, and how much I don’t swim.

For many years I had custom in-ear monitors, but the convenience of wireless overcame that, even before they started taking headphone jacks out of phones. Bragi now allows you to send in ear molds from an audiologist and they’ll make these custom true wireless headphones that fit and sound great, but I have trouble recommending because the case is so heavy and once got so jammed I almost thought I’d have to throw the whole thing away, and the app has never been able to “connect” for me because it gets stuck on turning on some fitness sensors. If it could connect I think I could turn off the other feature that is annoying, which is the touch controls that I find get triggered by my hat or when my head is against a chair. So, a qualified “maybe try this.”</li><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4LBOV6/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Sennheiser Culture Series Wideband Headset</a>, which I use for podcasts, Skype, Facetime, Zoom, and Google Hangout calls with external folks and teams inside of Automattic. Light, comfortable, great sound quality, and great at blocking out background noise so you don’t annoy other people on the call. I’d love to replace this with something wireless but haven’t found one with as high fidelity audio.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07712LKJM/?tag=photomatt08-20\">GL.iNet GL-AR750 Travel AC Router</a> which I use to create wifi networks different places I go, which is often faster than hotel/etc wifi, and I can also VPN encrypt all my traffic through it. Pretty handy! But not user-friendly. Often keep it in my suitcase and not my backpack. I have a retractable Ethernet and micro-USB attached to it.</li><li>Matte black Airpods. I love Airpods and these look super cool, I think these were from BlackPods which looks shut down now but <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-743-apple-airpods.aspx\">Colorware has some alternatives</a>.

(4th year)</li><li>An ultralight running jacket I think I got at Lululemon Lab in Vancouver.

It offers support for multisite as well as several popular plugins, such as ACF, bbPress, BuddyPress, EDD, Gravity Forms, WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, and Jetpack. Stream hasn&#8217;t gained much traction in recent years with just 30,000 active installations. </p>\n<p>In 2014, Stream&#8217;s creators explored offering <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stream as a service</a> where the logs were stored in AWS and included configurable SMS notifications. The service was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shut down in 2015</a> in favor of storing the activity logs locally due to the expense of cloud storage. Shortly after that it was acquired by XWP.</p>\n<p>Automattic is also exploring offering its new Activity feature as a paid service. Currently sites on the Free plan only have access to the last 20 most recent events. Access is tiered based on the plan. Personal and Premium users have access to activities from the last 30 days and Professional users can see all activities for the past year. The ability to filter activities by type is also restricted to paid users only.</p>\n<p>Jetpack site owners should note that Activity is activated by default &#8211; it&#8217;s not a module that can be turned on or off. The feature doesn&#8217;t send any new data to WordPress.com but rather offers a new interface for data that is already synced.</p>\n<p>The full list of activities the feature collects, as well as privacy information related to data retention, is available for <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/activity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com</a> and <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/activity-log/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack sites</a> in the documentation for the feature.

The team, largely a group of unpaid volunteers, collaborated on a detailed assessment that publicly challenges Gutenberg&#8217;s readiness for core in a way that no other WordPress team has done through official channels to date. After a week of testing the most recent version of the plugin, the team concluded that they cannot recommend Gutenberg to be used by anyone who relies on assistive technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Accessibility team – like any team in WordPress – has no specific authority over the project. Because we’re a small team of volunteers, we’ve been pragmatic in how we apply the guidelines. We have made tradeoffs in prioritization. Gutenberg is a place where we feel it is necessary to draw a line. The ability to author, edit, and publish posts is the primary purpose of WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Accessibility team rep Joe Dolson, speaking on behalf of the team, cited cognitive load and complexity, inconsistent user interface behavior, heavy reliance on keyboard shortcuts, and difficulties with keyboard navigation through blocks, among other concerns about Gutenberg. He outlined an example of the keyboard sequence required to do something as simple as change the font size in a paragraph block. It currently requires 34 separate keyboard stops, and even more if the tester doesn&#8217;t have prior knowledge of how to navigate Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because the complexity of interaction with Gutenberg is an order of magnitude greater than in the classic editor, we believe that Gutenberg is less accessible than the existing classic editor, though it offers many great features that are not available in the current editor,&#8221; Dolson said. </p>\n<p>This assessment echoes many of the common themes found in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg&#8217;s reviews on WordPress.org</a>, even among the most recent reviews of the latest version. Ratings are currently hovering at 2.3 out of 5 stars. Users have repeatedly said the interface is &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-is-a-clear-winner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">far too heavily reliant on hover based functionality</a>.&#8221; Even those without accessibility needs find it <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/blocks-concept-seems-great-but-still-so-confusing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confusing</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/rage-inducing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unintuitive</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/an-unusable-codewreck/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">difficult to navigate content</a>. Some testers find it <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fixing-what-isnt-broken-w-broken-tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nearly impossible to do what they want to do with it</a>.</p>\n<p>The positive reviews recognize the software as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/much-needed-update-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a work in progress</a> and testers seem more aware of the overall vision for the plugin. They are excited about some of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/my-experience-with-gutenberg-the-good-and-not-so-good/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more advanced features that blocks offer</a>, but many positive reviewers urge WordPress to give it more time before making it the default editor.</p>\n<p>The accessibility team is convinced that the main accessibility issues in Gutenberg stem from design issues. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is the way of the future in WordPress, but the direction it has taken so far has been worrying,&#8221; Dolson said. &#8220;We do not want to miss the opportunity to build a modern and inclusive application for WordPress, but in order to achieve that goal, accessibility needs to incorporated in all design processes in the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These problems are solvable. Retrofitting accessibility is not an effective process. It is costly in terms of time and resources.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a recent post titled <a href=\"https://pento.net/2018/10/26/iterating-on-merge-proposals/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iterating on Merge Proposals</a>, Gary Pendergast, who is leading the merge of Gutenberg into core, acknowledged that they could have asked for the accessibility team&#8217;s help much earlier in the process. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The Accessibility team should’ve been consulted more closely, much earlier in the process, and that’s a mistake I expect to see rectified as the Gutenberg project moves into its next phase after WordPress 5.0,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;While Gutenberg has always aimed to prioritize accessibility, both providing tools to make the block editor more accessible, as well as encouraging authors to publish accessible content, there are still areas where we can improve.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At this time there has been no official response to the accessibility team&#8217;s assessment. It does not look like it will meaningfully impact the release date, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beta 2</a> went out last night and RC 1 is planned for release today. If the core dev chats are any indication, contributors involved in 5.0 seem to be on board with the ambitious timeline for its release. </p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://werdswords.com/accessibility-in-gutenberg-is-not-a-one-more-feature/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accessibility in Gutenberg is not a one-more feature</a>,&#8221; core developer Drew Jaynes urges the project&#8217;s leadership and contributors not to compromise core accessibility standards for the sake of an expedited timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please let&#8217;s not make the &#8216;new standard&#8217; be that we&#8217;re willing to ship technically accessible but perhaps not entirely usable-for-all features; let&#8217;s not define it as one that sacrifices standards core to the WordPress experience in the name of perceived expediency; let&#8217;s not define it as the new default authoring experience for all users when not all users can use it well,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 release lead Matt Mullenweg has frequently said the release will ship when it&#8217;s ready. He contends that the interface has been continually modified for accessibility needs throughout the process of developing Gutenberg. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Modifying the interface to accomodate a11y is the compromise, it has been continuous throughout the process. I don\'t know how to achieve the imaginary bar you\'re setting up.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1055889800119508992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 26, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Matthew MacPherson, Gutenberg&#8217;s accessibility lead, was not immediately available for comment on the team&#8217;s assessment. Ultimately, the decision to delay the release will fall to Mullenweg and his leadership team. The accessibility team, however, will not lend its endorsement of Gutenberg at this time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The accessibility team will continue to work to support Gutenberg to the best of our ability. However, based on its current status, we cannot recommend that anybody who has a need for assistive technology allow it to be in use on any sites they need to use at this time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg is now 20 days away from landing in WordPress 5.0, but this does not leave enough time to solve the design and architectural issues the accessibility team has identified. They have <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44671\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposed a notice</a> on the 5.0 release to inform administrators of Gutenberg&#8217;s inadequacy for users of assistive technology, with a prompt to install the Classic Editor plugin. Many people with accessibility needs depend on the WordPress editor in order to do their work and will need to stick with the old interface. The proposal has been closed with a note indicating that 5.0 will point users to the Classic Editor plugin if they need it.</p>\n<p>The mistake of not having consulted accessibility experts in the design phase cannot be easily rectified at this point, but the Classic Editor is still available for those who need to preserve their same workflow. The conflict lies in whether WordPress should ship a new editor that those with accessibility needs cannot immediately use. It is a somewhat painful and frustrating outcome for those users when the entire ecosystem is rapidly moving towards Gutenberg as the standard. </p>\n<p>Either the accessibility and usability issues the team identified are not as bad as they purport or this document is a last-minute clarion call that could prevent WordPress from shipping an editor that excludes users who rely on assistive technology. Due to the gravity of their claims, the accessibility team&#8217;s statement on Gutenberg demands an official response.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 19:16:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.0 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6222\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2230:\"<p>WordPress 5.0 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

PHP 7.3 compatibility has been improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>We&#8217;re fixing the bugs:<br />All the ones you&#8217;ve reported.<br />Some that we&#8217;ve found, too.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 05:04:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Gary Pendergast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: php[world] 2018 to Feature Full-Day Gutenberg Development Workshop\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=85120\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/phpworld-2018-to-feature-full-day-gutenberg-development-workshop\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4715:\"<p>The fourth annual <a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">php[world]</a> conference is just two weeks away. The event is dedicated to uniting the PHP community and will be held November 14-15, 2018, in Washington, D.C. </p>\n<p>This year the organizing team created a &#8220;Content Advisory Board&#8221; to ensure the event included sessions that will appeal to everyone. The board includes two WordPress Developers, two Drupal developers, and two more more general PHP developers. They reviewed all incoming talk submissions and gave organizers ideas on what they thought would be of greatest interest to each community.</p>\n<p>php[world] has traditionally included several topics and speakers from the WordPress world. This year the program features a full-day training workshop on Gutenberg development led by Josh Pollock and Zac Gordon. The workshop is called <a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/modern-wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of WordPress Development</a> and is available through a <a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/register/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">separate day ticket</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always tried to focus php[world] on being the PHP conference that appeals to WordPress and Drupal developers as well,&#8221; conference co-chair Eli White said.  &#8220;We all write PHP (and JavaScript) code, and the DC area is full of WordPress and Drupal development shops. In fact, the majority of people in the local PHP user groups are doing WordPress development anyway. So we should all just be learning from each other. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For WordPress, that was obviously Gutenberg. Currently the release date for WordPress 5.0 and Gutenberg is November 19th, just a few days after php[world], and so it&#8217;s a really important topic for any developer who works with WordPress to be familiar with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Workshop attendees can expect to become better acquainted with extending Gutenberg. The instructors plan to cover the basics of block creation as well as more advanced topics like making blocks dynamic and creating advanced blocks with the WordPress REST API and Redux.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the workshop, our goal is to get folks comfortable with what they could do with Gutenberg,&#8221; Josh Pollock said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll cover the anatomy of a block, and different patterns for creating simple and complex blocks. We&#8217;ll go over each of the types of block types you can create and have hands-on time to play with these new skills and ask real time questions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Developers should leave with an understanding of the different types of blocks they can build and why. They&#8217;ll also get plenty of example code, links, and advice they can use when it&#8217;s time to build blocks for their own WordPress projects.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The event includes a few other sessions geared towards WordPress developers: David Wolfpaw is giving a workshop called &#8220;<a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/building-wordpress-themes-a-primer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Building WordPress Themes: A Primer</a>&#8221; and Mo Jangda from Automattic is giving a talk on &#8220;<a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/handle-an-outage/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Handle a Site Outage</a>.&#8221; There is another full-day training on modern PHP security that happens the day before the Gutenberg workshop that White said the WordPress Developers on the content board urged them to include.</p>\n<p>The main conference is also hosting many sessions that would benefit WordPress developers who want to sharpen their PHP skills. A few highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steve Grunwell is giving a &#8220;<a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/a-crash-course-in-php-namespaces-for-wordpress-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Crash-Course in PHP Namespaces</a>.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Sara Goleman, a core PHP contributor, will be talking about &#8220;<a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/php-now-and-tomorrow/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PHP: Now and Tomorrow</a>,&#8221; discussing the PHP roadmap for 7.4 and 8.0.</li>\n<li>Brandon Savage is giving a two-hour workshop on &#8220;<a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/sessions/practical-object-oriented-design-principles/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Object-Oriented Design Principles</a>,&#8221; designed to be a an introduction or refresher on OOP best practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://world.phparch.com/schedule/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full schedule</a> on the php[world] website.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 22:36:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 3.5 Introduces REST API v3, Improves Transactional Emails\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-5-introduces-rest-api-v3-improves-transactional-emails\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3596:\"<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2018/10/23/woocommerce-3-5-is-here/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce 3.5</a> was released this week. It&#8217;s a minor update that has been in development since May and began testing in September. The release should be backwards compatible to version 3.0 of the plugin but users are always advised to test all of their themes and extensions before updating.</p>\n<p>Store owners can expect to see a change in the copy of the default transactional emails. They have been <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/21288\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated to be friendlier and more human</a>. This is particularly important for the customer-facing emails. All of the following have been updated: on-hold, processing, completed, refunded both full and partially, invoice both with a pending and non-pending status, customer notes, password reset, new account. The default content in the store admin emails has also been improved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/payment-received.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The WooCommerce team anticipates that the updates to the transactional emails will reduce the need for store owners to customize their email templates. It also gives customers a better, friendlier connection to the store. More updates to the email content editing experience are planned for 2019. </p>\n<p>Store owners may also benefit from the new option to set a low stock threshold in the inventory tab for individual products, export products by category to the CSV exporter, and define custom product placeholder images that will resize to correct store aspect ratio. </p>\n<p>The WooCommerce REST API continues to evolve with v3 introduced in this release. It adds new endpoints required for the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/wc-admin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wc-admin feature plugin</a>, the React-powered WooCommerce admin interface that was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-new-woo-adopts-gutenberg-components-user-interface-driven-by-react\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">featured at last week&#8217;s WooSesh</a>. REST API v3 also adds new features to existing endpoints while maintaining backwards compatibility with legacy API versions.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.5 introduces support for the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-custom-product-tables-plugin-now-in-beta-boasts-30-faster-page-loads\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Product Tables feature plugin</a>, which is being developed to improve store performance and scalability. In some cases storing product data in custom tables has brought <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/woocommerce-custom-product-tables-beta/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30% faster page loads</a>. </p>\n<p>In version 3.5 the &#8220;Preview Changes&#8221; button was <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/20650\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">removed from the publish meta box when editing products</a>.

McAlister has been developing WordPress themes since 2009. He initially sold his themes on ThemeForest. In 2011, he founded Array Themes.</p>\n<p>I reached out to McAlister to learn why he chose to be acquired, what excites him most about Gutenberg, and what the plans are going forward.</p>\n<h2>Interview with Mike McAlister</h2>\n<h4><strong>What ultimately made you decide to move on from managing your own theme and products company to a larger, more established company?</strong></h4>\n<p>The catalyst was when Brian Gardner reached out this summer and started a conversation about joining his team at <a href=\"https://wpengine.com\">WP Engine</a>. As I told him at the time, he certainly wasn&#8217;t the first to make that offer, but he was definitely the most interesting. I had always respected Brian&#8217;s ethos on quality and design and really enjoyed our chats over the years.</p>\n<p>Once I started meeting folks at WP Engine like Jason Cohen and David Vogelpohl, it became obvious that we were all striving for the same future and outcome for customers. It just made sense to join forces to make it happen together.</p>\n<p>This was also a unique opportunity for me to start fresh and focus on crafting products with a stellar team. Although I was able to create an industry-respected theme collection and recently the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\">Atomic Blocks</a> plugin for Gutenberg, I wanted a new challenge. </p>\n<h4><strong>Couldn&#8217;t Array Themes have been built to directly support the Genesis framework without being acquired by WP Engine?</strong></h4>\n<p>It would be a lot of work to infuse the Array Themes collection and Genesis. The idea wasn&#8217;t exactly to bring Genesis to Array, rather to bring the expertise and craft of Array and Atomic Blocks to WP Engine, StudioPress and Gutenberg. </p>\n<p>StudioPress already has one of the biggest and best theme collections out there and is doubling down on Gutenberg support. I&#8217;m going to contribute what I&#8217;ve learned building Array Themes and Atomic Blocks to make the StudioPress offering even better.</p>\n<h4><strong>Will future themes require the Genesis framework?</strong></h4>\n<p>Although there will not be any new themes released under the Array Themes brand, some of the designs will live on as <a href=\"https://my.studiopress.com/themes/\">StudioPress themes</a> in the future and those will be powered by the Genesis framework. </p>\n<p>We&#8217;re working on some really exciting new themes and features for Genesis that are going to continue making it the go-to solution for creating beautiful websites on WordPress, especially in the Gutenberg era.</p>\n<h4><strong>What do you think of the consolidation of brands in the WordPress space?</strong></h4>\n<p>We&#8217;re seeing a very unique and transitional time in the WordPress industry. The old way of doing things is going out the window as WordPress and its community changes before our eyes. </p>\n<p>Now, more than ever, WordPress needs companies with stellar talent to help usher it through to the next era and contribute to its long term success. I&#8217;m excited to be part of a team that is willing to take on that challenge!</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t speak to the motivations of other businesses in the WordPress space, but the WP Engine acquisition of the Array product suite makes a lot of sense. </p>\n<p>With their recent acquisition of StudioPress, Array Themes, and Atomic Blocks, WP Engine is showing its customers and the WordPress community that they are doubling down on quality, design, Gutenberg, and an unmatched customer experience. These are all shared qualities between these individual entities and part of the long term strategy at WP Engine.</p>\n<h4><strong>What excites you most about Gutenberg?</strong></h4>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been excited about Gutenberg for over a year now. I was one of the first WordPress product developers to release a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\">blocks plugin</a>, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/atomic-blocks/\">Gutenberg-friendly theme</a>, <a href=\"https://atomicblocks.com/blog/\">a blog with tutorials</a>, and the <a href=\"http://gutenberg.news/\">Gutenberg News</a> site. </p>\n<p>I created all of these resources as a way of learning Gutenberg as well as contributing back to the community, and I will continue to do that with WP Engine and StudioPress!</p>\n<p>Gutenberg unlocks the WordPress editor and the endless opportunities that follow for content creators, developers, and everyone in between. Gutenberg is already responsible for a flood of new products and new solutions to problems the classic editor couldn&#8217;t solve and it hasn&#8217;t even been merged into core yet! </p>\n<p>The reality here is that Gutenberg isn&#8217;t just the future of WordPress, it&#8217;s the future of the Internet.</p>\n<h2>Discounts Available for Array Themes Customers<br /></h2>\n<p>McAlister is joining WP Engine as a full-time employee. In addition, <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/about/\">John Parris</a>, a code wrangler for Array Themes has also joined WP Engine. </p>\n<p>StudioPress and WP Engine are offering discounts to single theme and theme club members.

Thanks to the flexibility that this model offers, folks have been able to iterate rapidly on a wide range of features, touching just about every part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Features as Plugins&#8221; idea was first introduced during the WordPress 3.7 development cycle, during which the features were merged after a short discussion during a core chat: it was only in the WordPress 3.8 cycle that the idea of a merge proposal post (called &#8220;Present Your Feature&#8221; back then) came into being. It was envisioned as a way to consult with WordPress leaders, key contributors, and the wider WordPress community on the readiness of this feature to be released. Ultimately, WordPress leaders would make a decision on whether the feature was right for WordPress, and the release lead would decide if it was ready for that release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, most feature plugins have published some form of merge proposal post before they were ultimately merged into WordPress, and they&#8217;ve nearly all benefited to some degree from this process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">The merge proposal process has worked well for smaller features, but it struggled with larger changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The REST API is a great example of where the merge proposal process didn&#8217;t work. The REST API was a significant change, and trying to communicate the scope of that change within the bounds of a single merge proposal post didn&#8217;t really do it justice. It was impossible to convey everything that was changing, how it all worked together, and what it meant for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d go so far as to say that the shortcomings of the merge proposal process are at least partially responsible for why the REST API hasn&#8217;t seen the level of adoption we&#8217;d hoped for. It&#8217;s managed to gain a moderate amount of popularity with WordPress development agencies, and a handful of plugins use it in some ways, but it never really entered into mainstream usage in the ways it could&#8217;ve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">In a project that prides itself on being willing to try new ideas, the merge proposal process has remained largely static for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is the first opportunity since the REST API was merged where we can examine the shortcomings of the merge proposal process, and see how we can apply the original intent of it to the Gutenberg project&#8217;s scope and long term vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Merge Consultation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last six months, Gutenberg project leads have been consulting with teams across the WordPress project. Helping them get involved when they didn&#8217;t have any Gutenberg experience, explaining how their focus fit into the vision for Gutenberg, and listening to feedback on where things needed to be improved. In many circumstances, this consultation process has been quite successful: the WordPress Media and REST API teams are great examples of that. Both teams have got up to speed on the Gutenberg project, and have provided their valuable experience to make it even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s been entirely successful. There&#8217;s been a lot of discussion about Gutenberg and Accessibility recently, much of it boils down to what <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2018/10/some-gutenberg-accessibility-clarifications/\">Joe Dolson summarised</a> as being &#8220;too little, too late&#8221;. He&#8217;s correct, the Accessibility team should&#8217;ve been consulted more closely, much earlier in the process, and that&#8217;s a mistake I expect to see rectified as the Gutenberg project moves into its next phase after WordPress 5.0. While Gutenberg has always aimed to prioritise accessibility, both <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/18/regarding-accessibility-in-gutenberg/\">providing tools to make the block editor more accessible, as well as encouraging authors to publish accessible content</a>, there are still areas where we can improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there&#8217;s much to be discussed following WordPress 5.0, we can already see now that different teams needed to be consulted at different points during the project. Where Gutenberg has aimed to consult with teams earlier than a previous feature plugin would&#8217;ve, we need to push that further, ensuring that teams are empowered to get involved earlier still in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">All feature plugins in the future, great and small, will benefit from this iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a framework for more fluid feedback over the entire lifecycle of a feature project is beneficial for everyone. WordPress teams can ensure that their feedback is taken on board at the right time, project leads gain experience across the broad range of teams that work on WordPress, and projects themselves are able to produce a better resulting feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They important thing to remember throughout all of this is that everything is an experiment. We can try an approach, discover the weaknesses, and iterate. We&#8217;re all only human, we all make mistakes, but every mistake is an opportunity to ensure the same mistake can&#8217;t happen again. Sometimes that means changing the software, and sometimes that means changing the processes that help build the software. Either way, we&#8217;re always able to iterate further, and make WordPress fun for everyone. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 03:30:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 335 – Introduction to BigCommerce with Topher DeRosia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=85070&preview=true&preview_id=85070\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-335-introduction-to-bigcommerce-with-topher-derosia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1798:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/\">Topher DeRosia</a>, a developer evangelist for <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/\">BigCommerce</a>. DeRosia introduces what BigCommerce is, why users and developers should take a look at it, and why they&#8217;re making a big push into the WordPress space.

The organization is a community of more than 800 web professionals, educators, and others who work with WordPress in higher education. WPCampus director Rachel Cherry <a href=\"https://wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a request for proposals</a> detailing the organization&#8217;s specific concerns:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our organization is sensitive to the legal requirements set by <a href=\"https://section508.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a>. The recent 508 refresh brought these requirements in line with <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WCAG 2.0 level AA</a>, an industry standard that helps ensure accessibility. WCAG 2.0 is also <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commonly used as a baseline for policies</a> governing many WPCampus participants outside the United States, with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/09/wcag-2-1-adoption-in-europe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European Union already moving to WCAG 2.1</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The audit is aimed at determining potential legal risk for institutions upgrading to WordPress 5.0 and will also identify specific challenges that Gutenberg introduces for assistive technology users and others with accessibility needs.</p>\n<p>WPCampus is funding the audit and is not soliciting contributions from the community at this time. However, Pagely has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pagely/status/1055289065883365377\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">offered to donate $1,000 to the organization</a> in order to offset the costs of the audit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Contributions wise, at this point, we’d love for folks to share to help ensure we receive a wide variety of proposals,&#8221; Cherry said. WPCampus will publish the results of the audit to share with the greater WordPress community. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond our institutions’ legal obligations, colleges and universities worldwide have committed to providing an accessible digital experience to their diverse communities,&#8221; Cherry said. &#8220;This is consistent with the broader culture of higher education, which values inclusivity and an exchange of ideas free from artificial barriers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While the WordPress accessibility coding standards require new code to meet WCAG 2.0 AA, the new editor has not received a full accessibility audit. Lacking such an audit, the overall accessibility of Gutenberg is unclear. This makes it difficult for colleges and universities to determine the best course of action once WordPress 5.0 is released with Gutenberg as the default editor.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Accessibility Team is Preparing a Statement on Gutenberg&#8217;s Current Level of Accessibility</h3>\n<p>Accessibility has been one of the most pressing concerns regarding Gutenberg&#8217;s readiness for the world. The accessibility team met Monday and established a new weekly meeting time:&nbsp;15:00 UTC on Fridays. They discussed a communication plan for&nbsp;Gutenberg accessibility feedback, particularly in regards to&nbsp;Matthew<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/19/call-for-testers-community-gutenberg-accessibility-tests/\"> MacPherson&#8217;s call for accessibility testing</a> on the plugin. User testing was conducted in March but a lot has changed since then. MacPherson has called for another round of tests from the community after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-accessibility-audit-postponed-indefinitely\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic decided to forego his proposed independent audit</a> on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>The discussion became somewhat contentious after Gutenberg phase 2 lead Riad Benguella urged the accessibility team not to make its assessment in comparison to the classic editor but instead look at the larger picture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is meant for the whole site editing (even if it’s not at the moment) which means it’s the customizer + editor + menus + widgets at the same time,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;Just compare apples to apples, please, and if you see Gutenberg as an editor, you missed it. For the sake of iteration, it’s being shipped as an editor for now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several members of the accessibility team took issue with statement because Gutenberg will replace the classic editor in WordPress 5.0 (even if users can bring it back with a plugin).</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is <em>crucial</em> we compare these two experiences, because the one completely replaces the other,&#8221; Joe Dolson said. &#8220;It doesn’t matter that the new editor aims to do a lot more, it still must accomplish the same tasks effectively.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Amanda Rush, a blind WordPress user and accessibility specialist, concurred with Dolson&#8217;s assessment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As someone trying to use Gutenberg as it currently stands with a screen reader, I promise you that future goals for the project are the absolute furthest thing away from my brain at the time,&#8221; Rush said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let’s put it this way. Imagine that you are someone who must use assistive technology, or is otherwise reliant on something to do with Accessibility, and you have Gutenberg in front of you and you are trying to accomplish a task. Right now, the only task you can accomplish is writing or editing a post. So, as you are becoming more and more frustrated with the state of things, and trying to get your work done at the same time, imagine what it would be like if someone walked up to you in the middle of this frustrating experience and said well, if you’re calling as an editor you’ve missed it. Because this is going to be so much more than that. That is completely useless, doesn’t have any bearing on what you were trying to accomplish at the time, and promises, whether fairly or not, just more frustration down the road.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-beta-1-now-available-for-testing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beta 1</a> has arrived before the next round of accessibility testing has been completed, and Gutenberg has only recently arrived at UI freeze within the last week. The accessibility team is collaborating on a detailed article with a general and professional statement on the level of overall accessibility in Gutenberg. They plan to publish the statement on Friday.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, WPCampus has taken it upon themselves to spearhead an independent audit to determine if Gutenberg is in compliance with the industry standard WCAG 2.0 level AA, a standard which the accessibility team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adopted as a requirement for all new or updated code released in WordPress</a>. WPCampus&#8217; submission deadline for proposals is November 7, and the organization will select a vendor by November 30. The goal is to release the audit no later than January 17, 2019. </p>\n<p>The timeline WPCampus has identified would not deliver results in time to meaningfully impact WordPress 5.0&#8217;s release date. As Gutenberg has already been merged into core, it seems neither the accessibility team&#8217;s assessment nor an independent third-party audit would be considered a factor in delaying the release. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal with the timeline is to allow adequate time to do it right,&#8221; Cherry said. </p>\n<p>The WordPress community has responded positively to this independent effort to get more information on Gutenberg&#8217;s accessibility issues. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited for this process as an example of how the community can tackle large tasks like this in creative ways,&#8221; Jeremy Felt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyfelt/status/1055176432861634560\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to WPCampus&#8217; taking the initiative to get an audit. &#8220;It also has an opportunity to provide great insight and instruction on the accessibility of a complex React application with many interacting pieces.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/accessibility?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#accessibility</a> audit, spearheaded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpcampusorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@wpcampusorg</a>, is exciting.

Many in the community have expressed concern that if WordPress 5.0 ships a critically inaccessible new editor, it will be violating both its stated mission and its standards.</p>\n<p>A great deal of friction has surrounded Gutenberg&#8217;s journey towards becoming an accessible tool for millions of users. The struggle has highlighted areas where the WordPress project can improve its collaboration across teams. It has inspired many to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1054962217022640128\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">share</a> their personal stories and some have even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanwelcher/status/1055158337057239040\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a> to <a href=\"https://jonathandesrosiers.com/2018/10/accessibility-a-developers-pledge/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ramp up their accessibility contributions</a>.</p>\n<p>Many contributors were disappointed after Automattic decided to forego the independent accessibility audit on Gutenberg, given the company&#8217;s strong messaging about their passion for inclusive design. However, one positive outcome is that the company is now looking to <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/product-designer-accessibility/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hire a product designer who specializes in accessibility</a>. </p>\n<p>Rian Rietveld&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-lead-resigns-cites-political-complications-related-to-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">resignation from the accessibility team</a> was a great loss for the project but it served as a catalyst to bring more visibility to the efforts of WordPress&#8217; accessibility contributors. WPCampus&#8217; initiative to get an accessibility audit for Gutenberg is one example of how the community is rallying around the accessibility team and working to help make the new editor a success for all users, including those with accessibility needs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 19:53:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.0 Beta 1 Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-beta-1-now-available-for-testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2404:\"<p>WordPress 5.0 is marching forward with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-1/\">beta 1 released</a> this evening.

In September, Pendergast <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1537994851000100\">said</a> &#8220;the Gutenberg leads are ultimately responsible for the merge proposal&#8221; but the timeline was still to be determined. Unless a proposal is forthcoming, the project seems to have bypassed this stage, which has frequently been a requirement for new themes, APIs, and feature plugins in the past.</p>\n<p>Volunteers contributing to the Gutenberg handbook met for the first time today in the #core-docs channel. Chris Van Patten is coordinating the documentation effort to clean up and prepare Gutenberg-related docs for 5.0 over the next  five weeks.</p>\n<p>Testers are advised to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">consult the list of known bugs</a> before reporting to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta forum</a> or <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\">filing a bug on trac</a>.</p>\n<p>If this release stays on schedule, Gutenberg is now 26 days away from shipping in WordPress 5.0.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 00:35:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 02:43:25 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 02:30:27 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130911040210\";}', 'no');

SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER RELEASED A LETTER CALLING ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INTERNAL WATCHDOG TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER WHITAKER GAINED ACCESS TO SPECIAL COUNSEL INFORMATION PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT. SHANNON? &gt;&gt; Shan CATHERINE HERRIDGE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SECRETARY KIRSTJEN NIELSEN TONIGHT AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND SHE IS ECHOING THE PRESIDENT IN VOWING TO APPEAL A RULING BY AN OBAMA APPOINTEE, WHICH NOW BLOCKS THE PRESIDENTIAL THAT PREVENTS THE IMMIGRANTS FROM SEEKING ASYLUM IF THEY DON\'T APPLY AT A PORT OF ENTRY. &gt;&gt; LET ME BE CLEAR, THIS COURT FROM A CHAMBER IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS REPLACED A PRESIDENT\'S JUDGMENT WITH REGARDS TO THE FULLY DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS A TRUE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO OUR NATION\'S SOVEREIGNTY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND IT\'S A DISGRACE, I\'M GOING TO PUT IN A MAJOR COMPLAINT. EVERY CASE THAT GETS FILED IN THE NINTH CIRCUS, WE GET BEATEN AND END UP HAVING TO GO TO THE SUPREME COURT LIKE THE TRAVEL BAN, AND WE WON. THIS WAS AN OBAMA JUDGE, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IT\'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; Shan \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" TODAY ALSO CLAIMED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED TO ORDER THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO PROSECUTE DEMOCRATIC 2016 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE HILLARY CLINTON, AND FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. \"THE TIMES\" HE SAYS WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WROTE A MEMO WARNING THAT IF HE ASKED THE DOJ TO INVESTIGATE FOR POLITICAL LIBEL, HE COULD FACE POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT AND ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE OF POWER. ALL RIGHT, A LOT TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT WITH TONIGHT\'S LEGAL EAGLES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, ANDREW MacARTHUR McCARTHY, GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, SHANNON. &gt;&gt; Shan ERE IS SO MUCH TO START WITH, LET ME START WITH \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\" HIS ATTORNEY SPEAKING OUT TONIGHT ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESSURING HIM TO DO SOMETHING. THEY SAY MR. MCGANN WILL NOT COMMENT ON HIS LEGAL ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS FROM HIS ATTORNEY. HE SAID MR. McCANN WILL POINT OUT THAT THE PRESIDENT NEVER COMING TO HIS KNOWLEDGE, ORDERED THAT ANYONE PROSECUTE HILLARY CLINTON OR JAMES COMEY. THIS IS SOMETHING HE TALKED ABOUT DURING A LOT IN THIS CAMPAIGN, THAT HE AT LEAST WANTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT, HE TALKED ABOUT IT OPENLY. I THINK DON MCGAHN IS QUITE RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD NOT GET INTO A PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF HIS DELIBERATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT. I ALSO THINK, AND I WILL SAY WHAT I HAVE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING, SHANNON, I DON\'T THINK THE PRESIDENT DOES HIMSELF GOOD BY WEIGHING IN ON INVESTIGATIVE MATTERS, TALKING ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING, INVESTIGATIONS HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. I CAN TELL YOU, HAVING BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR 20 YEARS, IT DOESN\'T MAKE THE PROSECUTOR\'S JOB ANY EASIER BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE THAT WILL SUPPORT A CASE, THE PUBLIC NEVERTHELESS THINKS THAT THE CASE IS BEING BROUGHT BECAUSE OF POLITICAL PRESSURE RATHER THAN EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; Shan AH, AND TOM, WE ARE TOLD THAT ESSENTIALLY THERE WAS A MEMO PREPARED BY WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS FOR THE PRESIDENT SAYING THESE ARE ALL THE PROBLEMS, THE POTENTIAL MINEFIELD IF YOU GO DOWN THIS ROAD. YOU CAN\'T TELL THE DOJ TO PROSECUTE ANYONE, BUT EVEN LAUNCHING THE INVESTIGATION IS PROBABLY GOING TO CAUSE YOU MORE TROUBLE THAN IT\'S WORTH. &gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH THAT, AND I THINK WE MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT AND THAT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT ONCE YOU CROSS THAT LINE AND YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT DIRECTING PROSECUTIONS OR DIRECTING INVESTIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR CONVICTION, THAT ACTION BY THE PRESIDENT WILL TAINT THE ENTIRE PROCESS FOR MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA. THEY WOULD SAY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE HERE, THIS INVESTIGATION OF THIS PROSECUTION HAS A POLITICAL TASTE. ALTHOUGH WE DON\'T HAVE THE FULL STORY AT THIS HOUR, DOES SOUND LIKE THE PRESIDENT WAS GETTING SOME PRETTY GOOD LEGAL ADVICE FROM HIS IN-HOUSE AND CAME HERE &gt;&gt; Shan GAL ADVICE ON THIS LATEST RULING THAT BASICALLY PUT THE HOLD ON THIS ASYLUM POLICY IN PART, THE IDEA WAS, THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING IF YOU COME ACROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ASYLUM. AFTER COMES A REPORT OF ENTRY. A NINTH CIRCUIT JUDGE WHO PUT A NATIONWIDE INJUNCTION ON THAT, ESSENTIALLY SAID OF THE RULE BARRING ASYLUM FOR IMMIGRANTS ENTERING THE COUNTRY OUTSIDE A PORT OF ENTRY IRRECONCILABLE HE CONFLICTS WITH THE INTENT OF CONGRESS. WHATEVER THE SCOPE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S AUTHORITY, HE MAY NOT REWRITE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS TO TO THE CONDITIONS THAT CONGRESS HAS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN. AND PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY HAVE FELT THAT WAY ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND DACA. &gt;&gt; THE SAME ISSUE CAME UP WITH THE TRAVEL BAN, AND IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE CONDITION IS IRRECONCILABLE. IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THIS IS A REWRITE. IT IS NOT THE LAW THAT A FACT THAT ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE ALLOWED UNDER OUR LAW TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM WHEREVER THEY ARE REMAINS IN PLACE. THE PRESIDENT, IN DEALING WITH AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, UNDER A SWEEPING STATUTE OF CONGRESS, THE SUPREME COURT AFFIRMS HIS USE OF AND RELIANCE ON JUST FIVE MONTHS AGO, THE PRESIDENT HAS A 90 DAY SET OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE. AT THE END OF 90 DAYS, THEY LAPSE AND WE GO BACK TO THE STATUS QUO. THE TWO PROVISIONS ARE EASY TO RECONCILE WITH EACH OTHER, AND IT\'S CLEARLY NOT A REWRITE OF THE LAW. &gt;&gt; Shan E PRESIDENT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY FRUSTRATED. THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE WHOLE NINTH CIRCUS ON THE WEST COAST TODAY. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT FAIR. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO IMMEDIATELY RUN TO THIS VERY FRIENDLY CIRCUIT AND FILE THEIR CASE. IN MY OPINION, IT IS A DISGRACE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT. WE WILL WIN THAT CASE AND THE SUPREME COURT. &gt;&gt; Shan EN IF THEY DO, PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART AND DON\'T FILE THESE CASES IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT WHERE THEY KNOW IT\'S NOT VERY FRIENDLY, IT TAKES TIME AND EFFORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THE MEANTIME. &gt;&gt; IT OF IT AS A PEER TO THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT AND THE FACT THAT HE WILL HAVE A HARDER ROAD LITIGATING THIS IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT. THIS MAY WELL GO UP TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THE SUPREME COURT DOESN\'T HAVE TO TAKE EVERY CASE. THEY TOOK THE TRAVEL BAN COUNT MY CASE, THEY STOP THE NINTH CIRCUIT. BUT THE PRESIDENT LEGAL STRATEGY, HE\'S GOT A HOPE THAT THE JUSTICES ARE GOING TO BE WILLING TO STEP INTO THIS POLITICALLY FRAUGHT AREA OF IMMIGRATION AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Shan M AND ANDY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAVE A WONDERFUL THANKS GIVING IF I DON\'T SEE YOU AGAIN HERE TO SPEAK OUT THANKS -- &gt;&gt; TWO FEATURES OF THE EVOLVING TRUMP DOCTRINE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. PUT AMERICA FIRST. BUT SOME OF THE PRESIDENT\'S STAUNCHEST CONSERVATIVE DEFENDERS WORRY TOO LITTLE HEAT IS TAKEN ABOUT AMERICA\'S MORAL VOICE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. &gt;&gt; HEY, SHANNON. FOR WEEKS, THE WORLD HAS BEEN WONDER, WILL PRESIDENT TRUMP PUNISH THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT FOR MURDERING JOURNALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI? NOW WE KNOW. THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER REPERCUSSIONS COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES A GOOD U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONSHIP IS SIMPLY MORE IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; IT\'S ABOUT AMERICA FIRST. WE ARE GOING TO STAY WITH SAUDI ARABIA PAIR TO SPEAK OF HER TRUMP, IT\'S ABOUT PUTTING U.S. ECONOMIC INTEREST FIRST. A SPECIAL THAT $110 BILLION ARMS DEAL WITH THESE AUDIS. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE BUYING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF THINGS FROM THIS COUNTRY. IF I SAY WE DON\'T WANT TO TAKE YOUR BUSINESS, IF I SAY WE ARE GOING TO CUT IT OFF, THEY WILL GET THE EQUIPMENT, MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND OTHER THINGS FROM RUSSIA AND CHINA. RUSSIA AND CHINA WOULD BE VERY, VERY HAPPY. TO SPEAK OF THE DECISION COMES DESPITE A REPORT THAT THE CIA HAS DETERMINED THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ORDERED THE MURDER. BUT TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP AGAIN REFUSED THE ASSESSMENT OF HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. &gt;&gt; THE CIA HAS LOOKED AT IT, THEY HAVE STUDIED IT A LOT, THEY HAVE NOTHING DEFINITIVE, AND THE FACT IS, MAYBE HE DID, MAYBE HE DIDN\'T. &gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION IS BEING DENOUNCED BY MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES ON CAPITOL HILL, EVEN BY SOME OF HIS CLOSEST ALLIES. REPUBLICAN SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM CALLED THE CROWN PRINCE \"BEYOND TOXIC\" AND COMPARED TRUMP TO HIS PREDECESSOR, ONE THING I LEARNED DURING THE OBAMA YEARS IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY REGARDING TRUMP AND THE MIDDLE EAST, IT SELDOM WORKS OUT. SENATOR RAND PAUL SAID, I\'M PRETTY SURE THIS STATEMENT IS SAUDI ARABIA FIRST, NO AMERICA FIRST. &gt;&gt; IN THAT STATEMENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT CONGRESS WAS FREE TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, AND INDEED TONIGHT, SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS HE BELIEVES THERE WILL BE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR A SERIOUS SANCTIONS AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA. SHANNON, THE MESSAGE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT IS CLEAR. IT\'S PUTTING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND SECURITY ALLIANCES OVER THIS EGREGIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. &gt;&gt; Shan ANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH SO MUCH OUTCRY FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT TO THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS ON SAUDI ARABIA TODAY, WILL THE ADMINISTRATION BE FORCED TO TAKE A TOUGHER STANCE? RETIRED GENERAL AND FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST, GENERAL JOINED US NOW. GREAT TO SEE YOU, AS ALWAYS. WHAT ABOUT TRYING TO THREAD THIS NEEDLE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY, HIS CRITICS, THE PRESIDENT IS OVERHYPING THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THE DOLLARS AT STAKE. HE TALKED TODAY ABOUT THE JOINT GOAL OF HOW SAUDI ARABIA IS A PARTNER, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT OUTRAGED BY THIS MURDER AND THEY SEE THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO HAVE A STRONGER MORAL POSITION FOR OUR COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A STRATEGY FORWARD THAT IS NONEXCLUSIVE OF ALL ONE ANOTHER. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS OUTRAGEOUS CRIME HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT THE INTERSECTION OF AMERICA\'S NATIONAL INTEREST WITH A KEY ALLY AND AMERICA\'S VALUES. SO CAN WE DEVELOP A PATH FORWARD WHERE WE DEAL WITH BOTH OF THEM? I THINK WE CAN. FIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE ATOMIC SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF THIS CRIME. AND THEREFORE WE CAN EMPHASIZE AMERICA\'S VALUES. PART OF THE STRATEGY SHOULD BE TO SAVE THE SAUDIS, THE RELATIONSHIP IS DAMAGED. BUT IT IS REPAIRABLE, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT SOME CONDITIONS THAT WILL GOVERN YOUR BEHAVIOR IN THE FUTURE. WE WOULD HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THEM. ACCOUNTABILITY, FULL DISCLOSURE, REESTABLISHING TRUST. A TOLERATION POLICY FOR CRITICS AND DESCENDANTS. THAT WOULD ENABLE US, I BELIEVE, TO PUSH FORWARD MORAL CLARITY THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS HAD PEERED AT THE SAME TIME, MAINTAINS A RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, WE WOULD HAVE TO CONDEMN THE SAUDI REGIME PUBLICLY. WE ARE CONDEMNING THE CRIME, BUT WE HAVEN\'T CONDEMNED THE REGIME, BECAUSE IT\'S DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THE PLAUSIBLE THEORY THAT M.B.S. WAS NOT INVOLVED, OR THE CROWN PRINCE. BUT LET\'S JUST ACCEPT THAT FOR A MINUTE THAT HE\'S NOT. THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE EXECUTED IN OPERATION IN A FOREIGN LAND TO KILL A CRITIC WITH 15 SECURITY AGENTS. THEY DID THAT IN WHAT THEY BELIEVE WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGIME AUTHORITY, REGIME POLICY, AND REGIME CULTURE, PARTICULARLY AS IT PERTAINS TO BUSINESS. THAT MAKES THE REGIME CONDEMNABLE FOR THAT ACTION. I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A PATH FORWARD. I\'M NOT SUGGESTING TO WALK AWAY FROM THE ARMS DEAL, BUT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO GO FORWARD. I THINK WE CAN WIND UP ACTUALLY WITH A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP IF THE SAUDIS ARE TO MOVE TOWARDS MORE OF A VALUES PATH THAN WHAT THEY CURRENTLY ARE. &gt;&gt; Shan U THINK THERE\'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LABORATORY TO ACTUALLY GET THE BETTER OF THE DEAL AND ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WELL. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE DEFENSE SPENDING CONVERSATION WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE. THE IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE A 5% CUT ACROSS THE BOARD FROM E PENTAGON FOR DEFENSE. IN A FORBES PIECE, HE TALKS ABOUT THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS BEING IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE TWO SIDES HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THIS THING DONE. HE SAYS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME GOING FORWARD IS THAT MILITARY BUDGETS WILL FLATLINE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. HE SAYS THE DEVICE OF THE SYSTEM IS IN FAVOR OF CUTTING WEAPONS RATHER THAN PEOPLE WHEN MONEY BECOMES SCARCE, AND DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF CONGRESS WILL STRENGTHEN THAT BIAS. HOW DO YOU THINK IT IMPACTS THE MILITARY OVERALL? &gt;&gt; I ABSOLUTELY DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE PATH WE ARE CURRENTLY ON. WHAT THAT WILL DO, CLEARLY, IS A STOP IN THE RECOVERY OF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND AFTER 15 YEARS OF DECLINE. WHAT MAKES THIS A SERIOUS ISSUE IS THAT I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF A COMMISSION FOR THE LAST YEAR LOOKING AT OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY, AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT AND HAVE RECOGNIZED SOMEWHAT TO OUR ALARM BECAUSE OF THE DETAILS WE WERE ABLE TO GET INTO, IS HOW A SERIOUS DETERIORATION AND EVAPORATION HAS BEEN OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE PRIMARY MILITARY IN THE WORLD TODAY. IT PUTS US IN A DANGER WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN DECADES OF LOSING A CONVENTIONAL WORK, PARTICULARLY WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA. IN THE NEW COMMANDER WHO JUST TOOK OVER THE INDO PACIFIC A FEW WEEKS AGO SAID SOMETHING PRETTY SIMILAR. HE SAID THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE CAN WIN A WAR AGAINST CHINA TODAY. THOSE ARE ALARMING STATEMENTS MADE BY A SUPERPOWER ON THE UNITED STATES CAPACITY. WE HAVE GOT TO FIX THIS DETERIORATION, AND MUCH OF IT IS IN THE AREA THAT YOU JUST SUGGESTED HAS SUFFERED DECLINED. WE NEED TO GET BACK OUT ON A TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE WHERE WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE, NOT OUR ADVERSARIES. &gt;&gt; Shan EN YOU TALK ABOUT A POTENTIAL LOSS TO RUSSIA OR CHINA, THAT GETS PEOPLE\'S ATTENTION. WE ARE GLAD YOU ARE HERE WITH US. &gt;&gt; HAVE A GOOD THANKSGIVING. &gt;&gt; Shan ANK YOU. KENTUCKY BANS A CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION METHOD, THE ACLU SAYS THE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. KENTUCKY IS TRYING TO SHUT DOWN THE STATE\'S ONLY REMAINING ABORTION CLINIC. YOU WILL HEAR FROM KENTUCKY\'S GOVERNOR. AFTER THE BREAK. AND WILL THE DEMOCRATS TURN DEEP RED MISSISSIPPI BLUE? THE LAST DEBATE OF THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS IS IT TONIGHT. THE RUNOFF FROM MISSISSIPPI\'S U.S. SENATE SEAT IS NEXT TUESDAY AND THE POLLS ARE TIGHTENING THANKS IN PART TO THIS CONTROVERSIAL COMMENT. &gt;&gt; Shan NATOR CINDY HYDE-SMITH ADDRESSES THAT, TONIGHT AND LATER, ALLEGATIONS OF A MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD SCHEME IN LOS ANGELES. THERE EE &gt;&gt; Shan ARE NOW AWAITING A RULING ON AN ABORTION LAW IN KENTUCKY. AT THE STATE\'S ONLY ABORTION CLINIC AND THE ACLU ARE FIGHTING A KENTUCKY LAW THAT BANS A SECOND TRIMESTER ABORTION CALL DILATION AND EXTRACTION. THE ACLU ARGUES THE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. &gt;&gt; THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE ESSENTIALLY A BAN ON ABORTION IN KENTUCKY AFTER A CERTAIN POINT IN PREGNANCY, AND THAT IS GOING TO PUT HEALTH AND LIVES OF KENTUCKY WOMEN AT RISK. &gt;&gt; Shan T\'S BRING IN KENTUCKY\'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, MATT BEVIN, WHO IS BACKING THIS MEASURE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THINK YOU, SHANNON. &gt;&gt; Shan E TRIAL WRAPS UP IN FIVE DAYS, WE ARE WAITING FOR THE JUDGE TO RULE. IN THE MEANTIME, SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IT\'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DISCUSS BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DISMEMBERMENT OF A FETUS AND THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE DOCTORS TO MAKE SURE THE FETUS WAS ACTUALLY DEAD BEFORE THE PROCESS TAKES PLACE. HERE IS WHAT THE ACLU IS SAYING ABOUT THAT, AS WELL. THEY SAY THIS METHOD IS UNFEASIBLE, AND UNRELIABLE. IT REQUIRES ADVANCED TRAINING, PHYSICIANS AND PLAY DO NOT HAVE, AND IN SOME INSTANCE IT REQUIRES PHYSICIANS TO EXPERIMENT ON THEIR PATIENTS AND THAT IS TRULY THE BURDEN THAT THIS LAW WOULD PLACE ON WOMEN. YOUR RESPONSE? &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE. THE IDEA THAT A DOCTOR IS INCAPABLE OF LEARNING HOW TO DO THIS BUT IS BEING GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ABORT THIS CHILD SPEAKS VOLUMES IN AND OF ITSELF. THE DOCTORS ON THE STAND DURING THIS PAST WEEK ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WITH LITERALLY A DAY\'S WORTH OF TRAINING OR LESS, THEY WOULD BE QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR. THIS IS THE ACLU SIMPLY NOT WANTING THERE TO BE ANY OBSTACLES WHATSOEVER TO THIS BRUTAL AND BARBARIC APPROACH TO DISMEMBERING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. IT HAS A BEATING HEART, THIS CHILD HAS A HEART BEAT, BUT IS THEN DISMEMBERED IN THE PROCESS OF KILLING IT. IT IS BARBARIC AND GRUESOME, AND THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE HAVE SAID THAT IN OUR STATE WE THINK THAT IS UNCALLED FOR. THAT\'S SIMPLY WHAT WE ARE DEFENDING, THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE IN KENTUCKY IT IS A LIST WON\'T BE ALLOWED HERE. &gt;&gt; Shan ONG WITH THIS LAW, TWO OF THEIR KENTUCKY LAWS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO LEGAL CASES THAT ARE STILL PENDING, AS WELL. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE CRITICS WHO SAY THAT IT\'S REALLY NOT ABOUT A PARTICULAR METHOD SORT SPECIFIC THINGS THESE LAWS COVER, WHAT IT\'S REALLY ABOUT IS OUTLAWING ABORTIONS? &gt;&gt; THIS IS UNTRUE. ANYONE WHO IS SAYING THAT HAS NOT READ THIS BILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER ABORTION ITSELF IS A LEGAL OR NOT LEGAL, IT SIMPLY SAYS THE METHODOLOGY BY WHICH IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER AN ABORTION CAN BE PERFORMED CANNOT FROM THIS POINT GOING FORWARD, IF THIS BILL IS UPHELD, ALLOW THE DISMEMBERMENT OF A LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE PROCESS OF ABORTING THAT CHILD. IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT THAT CHILD MUST BE KILLED FIRST. IT\'S PREPOSTEROUS, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, SHANNON, THE FACT WE ARE EVEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IS REMARKABLE TO ME. IF THAT VERY SAME CHILD WAS DISCOVERED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF A HEART DYSRHYTHMIA, OR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE FIXED IN A UTERO, THERE WOULD BE AN ANESTHETIC APPLIED AND SURGERY WOULD BE DONE ON THAT SAME CHILD. WHY DO WE APPLY IN ANESTHETIC TO A CHILD IN THE WOMB WHEN PERFORMING SURGERY IF THAT CHILD REALLY FEELS NO PAIN? EVERYONE KNOWS THAT A CHILD FEELS PAIN. IF THE CHILD WAS IN THE WOMB AND WAS KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT, THE PERSON FILED RESPONSIBLE WOULD BE FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF THAT CHILD. SO IT\'S REMARKABLE TO ME THAT IN THIS INSTANCE THE ACLU WANTS TO PRETEND IT\'S NOT A CHILD WHEN LEGALLY IT IS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND PEOPLE KNOW IT FEELS PAIN. &gt;&gt; Shan U KNOW THE DEBATE ON CAPITOL HILL, THE 20 WEEK BAND, WHICH IS THE POINT AT WHICH SUPPORTERS OF THE BELL SITE AN UNBORN FETUS WOULD FEEL PAIN, THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THAT IS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE. THEY DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT. THEY MAY NOT BUY YOUR ARGUMENT. &gt;&gt; ARE MANY WHO THINK IT\'S ACTUALLY LONG BEFORE THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THIS CHILD HAS A HEARTBEAT, THE FACT THAT IT REACTS LITERALLY TO POKE AND/OR PRODS, IF YOU SEE TWINS, AND MY WIFE AND I HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO TWINS AND WE HAVE SEEN THE TWINS INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AT A VERY, VERY YOUNG AGE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, THERE IS NO QUESTION CHILDREN FEEL IN THE WOMB THE EXACT POINT AT WHICH SOME WOULD SAY IT\'S WELL BEFORE 20 WEEKS. THERE ARE VERY FEW CREDIBLE PEOPLE I HAVE EVER HEARD OF THAT DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT A CHILD FEELS PAIN AFTER 20 WEEKS. AND IF, IN FACT, THAT IS THE CASE, WHY DO THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE ADVOCATE TO APPLY AN ANESTHETIC WHEN PERFORMING SURGERY IN THE WOMB? WHY WOULD WE WASTE THE TIME AND MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IF THERE WAS NO PAIN INVOLVED? &gt;&gt; Shan KNOW THERE ARE VERY HEATED CRITICS AND OPPONENTS AND SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL IN KENTUCKY. WE WILL WATCH AND WAIT AS YOU DO FOR THE JUDGE\'S RULING. IN THE MEANTIME, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, GOVERNOR PAIR GOVERNOR. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; Shan OSECUTORS SAY THEY HAVE UNCOVERED A WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD SCHEME IN LOS ANGELES, AND IT\'S ALL BASED ON BRIBING HOMELESS PEOPLE TO FALSIFY VOTING DOCUMENTS. ALL THAT AND MORE WITH TONIGHT\'S POWER PANEL. ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; Shan IS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT, THE TRIAL OF A MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING A NEW YORK CITY WOMAN WHO WAS SEXUALLY ATTACKED WHILE JOGGING HAS ENDED IN A HUNG JURY. THE JUDGE GRANTING A MISTRIAL AFTER JUST A DAY AND A HALF OF DELIBERATION. JENNA LEWIS WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING A WOMAN AS SHE RAN IN QUEENS. THE DNA REPORTEDLY MATCHED HIS PROFILE AND THE JURY SAW HIS VIDEOTAPED CONFESSION. THE JUDGE CLAIMED THAT THE DNA EVIDENCE WAS SUSPECT. TONIGHT, THE L.A.P.D. HAS UD A LARGE SCALE VOTER SCAM. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, SHANNON. THIS IS ALL PART OF A CRACKDOWN ON VOTER FRAUD THAT THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT BEGAN A LONG PRIOR TO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. INVESTIGATORS DISCOVERED THAT THE HOME HOMELESS PEOPLE ON L.A L.A.\'S INFAMOUS SKID ROW WERE GIVEN A DOLLAR OR CIGARETTES IN EXCHANGE FOR PAUL SIGNATURES ON BALLOT PETITIONS. IN THE WORDS OF L.A.P.D. OFFICER, THEY PAID INDIVIDUALS TO ASSIGN NAMES. THAT\'S AN ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY. THE SIGNATURES WERE MOST COMMONLY USED TO GET CERTAIN PROPOSITION ONTO ELECTION BALLOTS. IT\'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES FALSELY GATHERED WERE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN ANY ONE PROPOSITION IT ONTO THE BALLOT IN THIS YEAR\'S MIDTERMS. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW, ANY STATEWIDE PROPOSITION NEEDS AROUND 365,000 SIGNATURES BEFORE IT CAN BE PUT TO VOTERS, AND AN L.A. COUNTY INITIATIVE, JUST UNDER 300,000. PEOPLE HIRED TO GET INITIATIVES ON THE BALLOT WERE OFTEN PAID PER TICK MAJOR, TYPICALLY $1 OR $2, ALTHOUGH THE RATE CAN BE AS HIGH AS $6 PER SIGNATURE. OFFICIALS SAY THOSE INVOLVED IN THIS GAME WERE FINANCIALLY NOT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. THE HEAD OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY ELECTIONS TOLD THE \"LOS ANGELES TIMES,\" IT IS NOT REALLY VOTER FRAUD IN TERMS OF ILLEGAL VOTING AND MANIPULATION, BUT I AM CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ACTIVITY THAT CAUSES A VOTERS TO LOSE FAITH IN THE PROCESS. NINE PEOPLE HAVE NOW BEEN CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCHEME. THEY RANGE IN AGE FROM 28 TO 62, AND EACH COULD FACE FIVE TO SIX YEARS IN PRISON IF CONVICTED. SHANNON? &gt;&gt; Shan NATHAN HUNT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FROM VOTER FRAUD TO VOTER SUPPRESSION, DEMOCRATS IN GEORGIA CONTINUE TO CLAIM VOTER REGISTRATION LAWS AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT COST THEM THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE. TIME NOW FOR TONIGHT POWER PANEL. FORMER OHIO SENATE MINORITY LEADER, COULD BREAK APART. SIENNA CALDWELL AND HOST OF FOX NATION, WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING. &gt;&gt; Shan WILL DO A LIGHTNING ROD SO WE CAN COVER A LOT OF TOPICS TONIGHT. I WANT TO START WITH THE ISSUE THAT JONATHAN WAS JUST REPORTING ABOUT ABOUT THIS FRAUD IN LOS ANGELES. THE \"LOS ANGELES TIMES\" SAID USING CASH AND CIGARETTES AS LEWIS, THE DEFENDANTS APPROACHED HOMELESS PEOPLE ON SKID ROW AND ASKED THEM TO FORGE SIGNATURES ON BALLOT PETITIONS AND VOTER REGISTRATION FORMS. TODD, START WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT LOS ANGELES LOOKS LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY WITH ALL THOSE TENTS IN THE STREET BECAUSE OF THE DEMOCRAT REGIME OVER THERE, IT\'S REALLY NO SURPRISE HERE THAT YOU HAVE VOTER FRAUD. LOOK, WE\'VE BEEN HEARING REPORTS ABOUT THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS, THEY HAVEN\'T SAID WHO THEY WERE SUPPORTING, TURN OUT TO BE DEMOCRATS. &gt;&gt; Shan LL, WE DO OFTEN HEAR THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD. &gt;&gt; THAT\'S A COMPLETE LIE. I\'M ACTUALLY IN CHICAGO RIGHT NOW, WHICH HAS A WELL-DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF VOTER CORRUPTION. LET\'S LOOK AT THE HISTORY, COMPILED AT A DATABASE, EVIDENCE OF ALMOST 1200 VOTER FRAUD CASES AND OF THEM, 1,000 OF THEM RESULTED IN CRIMINAL CONVICTION. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ELECTED OFFICIALS, DEMOCRATS, MOSTLY, WHO SAY VOTER FRAUD DOESN\'T EXIST, THAT\'S A THING OF THE PAST, WE SEE THAT THE EVIDENCE PROVES OTHERWISE. I THINK WE SHOULD BE TELLING EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Shan AT DO YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN \"VOTER FRAUD\" OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THIS IS FRAUD BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY VOTER FRAUD. IT IS FRAUD IN THE COLLECTION OF SIGNATURES, IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE SEEN ON THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2004 WHEN ACORN, PEOPLE WERE GETTING PAID TO COLLECT SIGNATURES, THIS IS VERY SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA. AS SOMEONE WHO SERVED AT THE STATE LEVEL IN OHIO, WHEN I WAS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL MODERNIZATION COMMISSION BACK IN THE BUCKEYE STATE, WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT REALLY IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO. ESSENTIALLY, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR THEIR GOVERNING RIGHTS THE PEOPLE ENTIRELY WITH THESE INITIATIVE PETITIONS, AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE. THESE FOLKS ARE GETTING PAID WITH CIGARETTES AND BOOZE AND WHATEVER ELSE TO GO COLLECT SIGNATURES BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT. RATHER THAN ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HAVING DELIBERATION IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND THAT IS WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY EFFECTIVE, AND THAT\'S EXACTLY WHY. &gt;&gt; Shan T\'S TALK ABOUT GEORGIA. I\'M GOING TO GO ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE THEREFORE GOVERNOR, STACY ABRAMS, DID NOT CONCEDE BUT SHE SAYS LEGALLY SHE RECOGNIZES THAT BRIAN KEMP IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. HERE\'S WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF GEORGIANS WHO WERE PURGED FROM THE ROLLS. BRIAN KEMP OVERSAW FOR EIGHT YEARS THE SYSTEMATIC AND SYSTEMIC DISMANTLING OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THAT MEANS THERE CANNOT BE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN GEORGIA THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; Shan LK? &gt;&gt; THIS WOMAN DISGUSTS ME, TO BE PERFECTLY BLUNT ABOUT IT. WHAT SHE AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IS TRY TO SMEAR EVERY VOTER, GOD-FEARING VOTER IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. SHE KNOWS VERY WELL THAT THE LOCAL COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UPKEEP AND FOR THE LOCAL VOTES. IT IS NOT BRIAN KEMP\'S RESPONSIBILITY. SHE IS EITHER IGNORANT OF THE FACTS OR SHE IS A FLAT OUT LYING. EITHER ONE IS UNACCEPTABLE SHE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF. &gt;&gt; WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO HER, SHANNON, IT SOUNDS LIKE A SORE LOSER. SHE IS VERY MUCH AWARE THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS UPHELD THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN THEM A SIX-YEAR PERIOD FOR THE VOTERS TO VOTE OR WHEN THEY STILL LIVE AT THAT ADDRESS, THEY SIGN AND SEND THEM BACK. THIS ISN\'T SOMETHING THAT IS AN ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY, AS STACY ABRAMS HAS A SUGGESTION APPEAR &gt;&gt; Shan IS CAME FROM OHIO. IF YOU DIDN\'T VOTE IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ELECTIONS, THEY WILL SEND OUT A CARD SAYING, DO YOU STILL LIVE HERE, IS THIS YOUR ADDRESS? AND IF THAT WAS NOT RETURN, YOU WERE WIPED OFF THE ROLLS. IT WASN\'T OVERNIGHT. I WANT TO READ SOMETHING FROM \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" IN A PIECE THEY HEADLINED \"DEMOCRACY SUCCEEDS IN GEORGIA,\" THEY SAY IF MR. KEMP WAS TRYING TO SUPPRESS VOTERS, HE DID A LOUSY JOB. GEORGIA VOTER ROLLS HAVE SWELLED SINCE 2010, AND EXPANSION IN ONLINE REGISTRATION. VOTER TURNOUT WAS UP 14%, WHICH IS EVEN GREATER THAN THE 12.6 INCREASE NATIONWIDE. EARLY VOTING ALSO DOUBLED SINCE 2014 AND THEY INCLUDED WITH THIS, BY ALL EVIDENCE, STACY ABRAMS BENEFITED FROM THIS SURGE IN TURNOUT. &gt;&gt; SURE, I THINK SOME OF THIS IS A BIT OF A POLITICAL NARRATIVE. FOR STACY ABRAMS TO CATCH HERSELF FOR A FUTURE ELECTION AND WRAP HERSELF IN SOMETHING THAT MAY BENEFIT HER FOR THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, FOR EXAMPLE. REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS VOTER SUPPRESSION, SO TO SPEAK. BUT I DO THINK IT WAS SOMEWHAT STRATEGIC BECAUSE WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR I THINK WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC RECOUNT, THERE WERE 20,000 UNCOUNTED PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH VOTER SUPPRESSION, BUT THERE WERE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING THAT BASICALLY AS MANY AS THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC RECOUNT. I THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO HOLD ON AND MAYBE THEY OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND. &gt;&gt; Shan LITERALLY NEED TEN SECONDS EACH FROM YOU GUYS ABOUT THIS MISSISSIPPI RUNOFF NEXT WEEK. IT\'S A VERY IMPORTANT SEAT FOR WHAT\'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE THE U.S. SENATE. CINDY HYDE-SMITH OBVIOUSLY TRIGGERING A LOT OF CONTROVERSY BY MAKING A STATEMENT THAT ONE OF HER SUPPORTERS, SHE WAS SUCH A FAN OF HIS, IF HE INVITED HER TO A PUBLIC HANGING, SHE WOULD BE IN THE FRONT ROW. THAT CAME UP TONIGHT IN A PUBLIC DEBATE. VERY QUICKLY, LET\'S GO ON THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. YOUR REACTION TO THIS RACE. &gt;&gt; TERRIBLE, WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MISSISSIPPI BUT THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS HANGING IN THE PALACE, AND THE WIDE-E OR THE BALLOT, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE SENATE WILL STAY IN REPUBLICAN HANDS BUT I\'M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE COMMENT, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE HISTORY OF MISSISSIPPI. &gt;&gt; Shan DD, CLOSE US OUT OUT. &gt;&gt; SHANNON, I\'VE GOT FAMILY IN MISSISSIPPI AND A SWEET LORD ALMIGHTY. SHE WAS THE DEMOCRAT BACK IN 2010, WHAT CAN I SAY? &gt;&gt; Shan IS GOING TO HANG IT THERE. ALL RIGHT, HAVE A GREAT THANKSGIVING. A FLORIDA SCHOOL DISTRICT EMBROILED IN A TRANSGENDER POLICY DEBATE. A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER ALLEGEDLY TOLD HE HAS TO SUPERVISE A BIOLOGICALLY FEMALE STUDENT WHO NOW IDENTIFIES AS MALE IN THE BOYS LOCKER ROOM. HE SAID HE WAS EJECTED AND HE WAS TOLD HE COULD COST HIM HIS JOB AND MAYBE HIS TEACHING LICENSE. WE ARE HERE NEXT WITH THE STORY.', 'RARE, MEDIUM, OR DONE WELL.

MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR LIFE.\" IT IS NOT A COOKBOOK OR A POLITICAL BOOK BUT IT HAS THE ENDORSEMENTS OF PEOPLE AS FAR TO THE LEFT AS A VAN JONES AND DO THE RIGHT AS ROBERT JEFFERSON. IT\'S AN INSPIRATION READ IT JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS AVAILABLE ONLINE AND IN BOOKSTORES EVERYWHERE, AND I HOPE YOU WILL CATCH MY WEEKEND SHOW, SATURDAY, SUNDAY AND EASTERN. GOOD NIGHT FROM ORLANDO. &gt;&gt; Shan NCE THAT IS NOT A COOKING BOOK, I WILL GIVE IT A TRY. THANKS, GOVERNOR. WELCOME TO \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.\" I AM SHANNON BREAM IN WASHINGTON. BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT ON MULTIPLE FRONTS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE IS PUTTING AMERICA FIRST BY NOT BREAKING TIES WITH SAUDI ARABIA WITH THE GRUESOME MURDER OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI. WE ARE ALIVE WITH ANALYSIS. AND SEVERAL LEGAL STORIES BREAKING TONIGHT. ARE TOP NOTCH ATTORNEYS WILL DEBATE FIRST. PRESIDENT TRUMP VOWING ACTION AGAINST THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AFTER A LOWER COURT JUDGE THEIR STRIKES DOWN YET ANOTHER DECISION. HE CALLS THE COURT OF A DISGRACE AND A RUBBER STAMP FROM HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES. ALSO TONIGHT, A MAJOR MILESTONE IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. THE PRESIDENT\'S LEGAL TEAM TURNING IN WRITTEN ANSWERS TO SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. PLUS THE UNIFORM TIMES CLAIMS PRESIDENT TRUMP ONE OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO PROSECUTE HILLARY CLINTON AND FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. FORMER COUNSEL IS SAYING TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID OR DID NOT ASK HIM TO DO. FOR COVERAGE TONIGHT, KRISTIN FISHER FOLLOWING NEW DEVELOPMENTS BUT LET US START WITH CATHERINE HAIRED WITH THE MUELLER PRO. &gt;&gt; SHANNON, TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT LEGAL TEAM ISSUED A BRIEF STATEMENT CONFIRMING THE WRITTEN RESPONSES ARE NOW WITH A SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE QUESTIONS IT DEALT WITH TOPICS. THE FIRING OF FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY AS PART OF ANY OBSTRUCTION. IT\'S BEEN OUR POSITION FROM THE OUTSET THAT MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN ASKED RAISED SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AND WAS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF TRADITIONAL UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION. IN THE PRESIDENT TEAM EMPHASIZED THEY HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED 30 WITNESSES PAID A 1.4 MILLION PAGES OF MATERIAL AND NOW THE PRESIDENT\'S WRITTEN RESPONSES. SHORTLY BEFORE THE CONFIRMATION FORM THE LEGAL TEAM, THE PRESIDENT FIELDED REPORTER QUESTIONS ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE ALL FINISHED. OF THE WRITTEN ANSWERS ARE FINISHED. I DON\'T KNOW, THE LAWYERS HAVE THEM. I DON\'T KNOW. THEY WILL. THE WRITTEN ANSWERS TO THE WITCH HUNT THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOREVER. NO COLLUSION, NO NOTHING. THEY HAVE BEEN FINISHED, FINISHED THEM YESTERDAY. THE LAWYERS HAVE THEM. I ASSUME THEY WILL TURN THEM IN TODAY, OR SO. &gt;&gt; EARLIER TODAY, DEMOCRATS LAUNCHED A THIRD FRONT ON THE ASSAULT OF THE LEGITIMACY OF ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL MATT WHITAKER. SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER RELEASED A LETTER CALLING ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INTERNAL WATCHDOG TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER WHITAKER GAINED ACCESS TO SPECIAL COUNSEL INFORMATION PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT. SHANNON? &gt;&gt; Shan CATHERINE HERRIDGE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SECRETARY KIRSTJEN NIELSEN TONIGHT AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND SHE IS ECHOING THE PRESIDENT IN VOWING TO APPEAL A RULING BY AN OBAMA APPOINTEE, WHICH NOW BLOCKS THE PRESIDENTIAL THAT PREVENTS THE IMMIGRANTS FROM SEEKING ASYLUM IF THEY DON\'T APPLY AT A PORT OF ENTRY. &gt;&gt; LET ME BE CLEAR, THIS COURT FROM A CHAMBER IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS REPLACED A PRESIDENT\'S JUDGMENT WITH REGARDS TO THE FULLY DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS A TRUE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO OUR NATION\'S SOVEREIGNTY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND IT\'S A DISGRACE, I\'M GOING TO PUT IN A MAJOR COMPLAINT. EVERY CASE THAT GETS FILED IN THE NINTH CIRCUS, WE GET BEATEN AND END UP HAVING TO GO TO THE SUPREME COURT LIKE THE TRAVEL BAN, AND WE WON. THIS WAS AN OBAMA JUDGE, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IT\'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; Shan \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" TODAY ALSO CLAIMED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED TO ORDER THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO PROSECUTE DEMOCRATIC 2016 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE HILLARY CLINTON, AND FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. \"THE TIMES\" HE SAYS WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WROTE A MEMO WARNING THAT IF HE ASKED THE DOJ TO INVESTIGATE FOR POLITICAL LIBEL, HE COULD FACE POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT AND ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE OF POWER. ALL RIGHT, A LOT TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT WITH TONIGHT\'S LEGAL EAGLES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, ANDREW MacARTHUR McCARTHY, GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, SHANNON. &gt;&gt; Shan ERE IS SO MUCH TO START WITH, LET ME START WITH \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\" HIS ATTORNEY SPEAKING OUT TONIGHT ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESSURING HIM TO DO SOMETHING. THEY SAY MR. MCGANN WILL NOT COMMENT ON HIS LEGAL ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS FROM HIS ATTORNEY. HE SAID MR. McCANN WILL POINT OUT THAT THE PRESIDENT NEVER COMING TO HIS KNOWLEDGE, ORDERED THAT ANYONE PROSECUTE HILLARY CLINTON OR JAMES COMEY. THIS IS SOMETHING HE TALKED ABOUT DURING A LOT IN THIS CAMPAIGN, THAT HE AT LEAST WANTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT, HE TALKED ABOUT IT OPENLY. I THINK DON MCGAHN IS QUITE RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD NOT GET INTO A PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF HIS DELIBERATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT. I ALSO THINK, AND I WILL SAY WHAT I HAVE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING, SHANNON, I DON\'T THINK THE PRESIDENT DOES HIMSELF GOOD BY WEIGHING IN ON INVESTIGATIVE MATTERS, TALKING ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING, INVESTIGATIONS HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. I CAN TELL YOU, HAVING BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR 20 YEARS, IT DOESN\'T MAKE THE PROSECUTOR\'S JOB ANY EASIER BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE THAT WILL SUPPORT A CASE, THE PUBLIC NEVERTHELESS THINKS THAT THE CASE IS BEING BROUGHT BECAUSE OF POLITICAL PRESSURE RATHER THAN EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; Shan AH, AND TOM, WE ARE TOLD THAT ESSENTIALLY THERE WAS A MEMO PREPARED BY WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS FOR THE PRESIDENT SAYING THESE ARE ALL THE PROBLEMS, THE POTENTIAL MINEFIELD IF YOU GO DOWN THIS ROAD. YOU CAN\'T TELL THE DOJ TO PROSECUTE ANYONE, BUT EVEN LAUNCHING THE INVESTIGATION IS PROBABLY GOING TO CAUSE YOU MORE TROUBLE THAN IT\'S WORTH. &gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH THAT, AND I THINK WE MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT AND THAT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT ONCE YOU CROSS THAT LINE AND YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT DIRECTING PROSECUTIONS OR DIRECTING INVESTIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR CONVICTION, THAT ACTION BY THE PRESIDENT WILL TAINT THE ENTIRE PROCESS FOR MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA. THEY WOULD SAY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE HERE, THIS INVESTIGATION OF THIS PROSECUTION HAS A POLITICAL TASTE. ALTHOUGH WE DON\'T HAVE THE FULL STORY AT THIS HOUR, DOES SOUND LIKE THE PRESIDENT WAS GETTING SOME PRETTY GOOD LEGAL ADVICE FROM HIS IN-HOUSE AND CAME HERE &gt;&gt; Shan GAL ADVICE ON THIS LATEST RULING THAT BASICALLY PUT THE HOLD ON THIS ASYLUM POLICY IN PART, THE IDEA WAS, THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING IF YOU COME ACROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ASYLUM. AFTER COMES A REPORT OF ENTRY. A NINTH CIRCUIT JUDGE WHO PUT A NATIONWIDE INJUNCTION ON THAT, ESSENTIALLY SAID OF THE RULE BARRING ASYLUM FOR IMMIGRANTS ENTERING THE COUNTRY OUTSIDE A PORT OF ENTRY IRRECONCILABLE HE CONFLICTS WITH THE INTENT OF CONGRESS. WHATEVER THE SCOPE OF THE PRESIDENT\'S AUTHORITY, HE MAY NOT REWRITE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS TO TO THE CONDITIONS THAT CONGRESS HAS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN. AND PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY HAVE FELT THAT WAY ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND DACA. &gt;&gt; THE SAME ISSUE CAME UP WITH THE TRAVEL BAN, AND IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE CONDITION IS IRRECONCILABLE. IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THIS IS A REWRITE. IT IS NOT THE LAW THAT A FACT THAT ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE ALLOWED UNDER OUR LAW TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM WHEREVER THEY ARE REMAINS IN PLACE. THE PRESIDENT, IN DEALING WITH AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, UNDER A SWEEPING STATUTE OF CONGRESS, THE SUPREME COURT AFFIRMS HIS USE OF AND RELIANCE ON JUST FIVE MONTHS AGO, THE PRESIDENT HAS A 90 DAY SET OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE. AT THE END OF 90 DAYS, THEY LAPSE AND WE GO BACK TO THE STATUS QUO. THE TWO PROVISIONS ARE EASY TO RECONCILE WITH EACH OTHER, AND IT\'S CLEARLY NOT A REWRITE OF THE LAW. &gt;&gt; Shan E PRESIDENT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY FRUSTRATED. THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE WHOLE NINTH CIRCUS ON THE WEST COAST TODAY. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT FAIR. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO IMMEDIATELY RUN TO THIS VERY FRIENDLY CIRCUIT AND FILE THEIR CASE. IN MY OPINION, IT IS A DISGRACE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT. WE WILL WIN THAT CASE AND THE SUPREME COURT. &gt;&gt; Shan EN IF THEY DO, PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART AND DON\'T FILE THESE CASES IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT WHERE THEY KNOW IT\'S NOT VERY FRIENDLY, IT TAKES TIME AND EFFORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THE MEANTIME. &gt;&gt; IT OF IT AS A PEER TO THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT AND THE FACT THAT HE WILL HAVE A HARDER ROAD LITIGATING THIS IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT. THIS MAY WELL GO UP TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THE SUPREME COURT DOESN\'T HAVE TO TAKE EVERY CASE. THEY TOOK THE TRAVEL BAN COUNT MY CASE, THEY STOP THE NINTH CIRCUIT. BUT THE PRESIDENT LEGAL STRATEGY, HE\'S GOT A HOPE THAT THE JUSTICES ARE GOING TO BE WILLING TO STEP INTO THIS POLITICALLY FRAUGHT AREA OF IMMIGRATION AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Shan M AND ANDY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAVE A WONDERFUL THANKS GIVING IF I DON\'T SEE YOU AGAIN HERE TO SPEAK OUT THANKS -- &gt;&gt; TWO FEATURES OF THE EVOLVING TRUMP DOCTRINE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. PUT AMERICA FIRST. BUT SOME OF THE PRESIDENT\'S STAUNCHEST CONSERVATIVE DEFENDERS WORRY TOO LITTLE HEAT IS TAKEN ABOUT AMERICA\'S MORAL VOICE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. &gt;&gt; HEY, SHANNON. FOR WEEKS, THE WORLD HAS BEEN WONDER, WILL PRESIDENT TRUMP PUNISH THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT FOR MURDERING JOURNALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI? NOW WE KNOW. THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER REPERCUSSIONS COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES A GOOD U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONSHIP IS SIMPLY MORE IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; IT\'S ABOUT AMERICA FIRST. WE ARE GOING TO STAY WITH SAUDI ARABIA PAIR TO SPEAK OF HER TRUMP, IT\'S ABOUT PUTTING U.S. ECONOMIC INTEREST FIRST. A SPECIAL THAT $110 BILLION ARMS DEAL WITH THESE AUDIS. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE BUYING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF THINGS FROM THIS COUNTRY. IF I SAY WE DON\'T WANT TO TAKE YOUR BUSINESS, IF I SAY WE ARE GOING TO CUT IT OFF, THEY WILL GET THE EQUIPMENT, MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND OTHER THINGS FROM RUSSIA AND CHINA. RUSSIA AND CHINA WOULD BE VERY, VERY HAPPY. TO SPEAK OF THE DECISION COMES DESPITE A REPORT THAT THE CIA HAS DETERMINED THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ORDERED THE MURDER. BUT TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP AGAIN REFUSED THE ASSESSMENT OF HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. &gt;&gt; THE CIA HAS LOOKED AT IT, THEY HAVE STUDIED IT A LOT, THEY HAVE NOTHING DEFINITIVE, AND THE FACT IS, MAYBE HE DID, MAYBE HE DIDN\'T. &gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION IS BEING DENOUNCED BY MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES ON CAPITOL HILL, EVEN BY SOME OF HIS CLOSEST ALLIES. REPUBLICAN SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM CALLED THE CROWN PRINCE \"BEYOND TOXIC\" AND COMPARED TRUMP TO HIS PREDECESSOR, ONE THING I LEARNED DURING THE OBAMA YEARS IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY REGARDING TRUMP AND THE MIDDLE EAST, IT SELDOM WORKS OUT. SENATOR RAND PAUL SAID, I\'M PRETTY SURE THIS STATEMENT IS SAUDI ARABIA FIRST, NO AMERICA FIRST. &gt;&gt; IN THAT STATEMENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT CONGRESS WAS FREE TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, AND INDEED TONIGHT, SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS HE BELIEVES THERE WILL BE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR A SERIOUS SANCTIONS AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA. SHANNON, THE MESSAGE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT IS CLEAR. IT\'S PUTTING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND SECURITY ALLIANCES OVER THIS EGREGIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. &gt;&gt; Shan ANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH SO MUCH OUTCRY FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT TO THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS ON SAUDI ARABIA TODAY, WILL THE ADMINISTRATION BE FORCED TO TAKE A TOUGHER STANCE? RETIRED GENERAL AND FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST, GENERAL JOINED US NOW. GREAT TO SEE YOU, AS ALWAYS. WHAT ABOUT TRYING TO THREAD THIS NEEDLE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY, HIS CRITICS, THE PRESIDENT IS OVERHYPING THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THE DOLLARS AT STAKE. HE TALKED TODAY ABOUT THE JOINT GOAL OF HOW SAUDI ARABIA IS A PARTNER, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT OUTRAGED BY THIS MURDER AND THEY SEE THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO HAVE A STRONGER MORAL POSITION FOR OUR COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A STRATEGY FORWARD THAT IS NONEXCLUSIVE OF ALL ONE ANOTHER. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS OUTRAGEOUS CRIME HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT THE INTERSECTION OF AMERICA\'S NATIONAL INTEREST WITH A KEY ALLY AND AMERICA\'S VALUES. SO CAN WE DEVELOP A PATH FORWARD WHERE WE DEAL WITH BOTH OF THEM? I THINK WE CAN. FIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE ATOMIC SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF THIS CRIME. AND THEREFORE WE CAN EMPHASIZE AMERICA\'S VALUES. PART OF THE STRATEGY SHOULD BE TO SAVE THE SAUDIS, THE RELATIONSHIP IS DAMAGED. BUT IT IS REPAIRABLE, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT SOME CONDITIONS THAT WILL GOVERN YOUR BEHAVIOR IN THE FUTURE. WE WOULD HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THEM. ACCOUNTABILITY, FULL DISCLOSURE, REESTABLISHING TRUST. A TOLERATION POLICY FOR CRITICS AND DESCENDANTS. THAT WOULD ENABLE US, I BELIEVE, TO PUSH FORWARD MORAL CLARITY THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS HAD PEERED AT THE SAME TIME, MAINTAINS A RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, WE WOULD HAVE TO CONDEMN THE SAUDI REGIME PUBLICLY. WE ARE CONDEMNING THE CRIME, BUT WE HAVEN\'T CONDEMNED THE REGIME, BECAUSE IT\'S DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THE PLAUSIBLE THEORY THAT M.B.S. WAS NOT INVOLVED, OR THE CROWN PRINCE. BUT LET\'S JUST ACCEPT THAT FOR A MINUTE THAT HE\'S NOT. THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE EXECUTED IN OPERATION IN A FOREIGN LAND TO KILL A CRITIC WITH 15 SECURITY AGENTS. THEY DID THAT IN WHAT THEY BELIEVE WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGIME AUTHORITY, REGIME POLICY, AND REGIME CULTURE, PARTICULARLY AS IT PERTAINS TO BUSINESS. THAT MAKES THE REGIME CONDEMNABLE FOR THAT ACTION. I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A PATH FORWARD. I\'M NOT SUGGESTING TO WALK AWAY FROM THE ARMS DEAL, BUT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO GO FORWARD. I THINK WE CAN WIND UP ACTUALLY WITH A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP IF THE SAUDIS ARE TO MOVE TOWARDS MORE OF A VALUES PATH THAN WHAT THEY CURRENTLY ARE. &gt;&gt; Shan U THINK THERE\'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LABORATORY TO ACTUALLY GET THE BETTER OF THE DEAL AND ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WELL. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE DEFENSE SPENDING CONVERSATION WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE. THE IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE A 5% CUT ACROSS THE BOARD FROM E PENTAGON FOR DEFENSE. IN A FORBES PIECE, HE TALKS ABOUT THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS BEING IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE TWO SIDES HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THIS THING DONE. HE SAYS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME GOING FORWARD IS THAT MILITARY BUDGETS WILL FLATLINE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. HE SAYS THE DEVICE OF THE SYSTEM IS IN FAVOR OF CUTTING WEAPONS RATHER THAN PEOPLE WHEN MONEY BECOMES SCARCE, AND DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF CONGRESS WILL STRENGTHEN THAT BIAS. HOW DO YOU THINK IT IMPACTS THE MILITARY OVERALL? &gt;&gt; I ABSOLUTELY DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE PATH WE ARE CURRENTLY ON. WHAT THAT WILL DO, CLEARLY, IS A STOP IN THE RECOVERY OF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND AFTER 15 YEARS OF DECLINE. WHAT MAKES THIS A SERIOUS ISSUE IS THAT I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF A COMMISSION FOR THE LAST YEAR LOOKING AT OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY, AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT AND HAVE RECOGNIZED SOMEWHAT TO OUR ALARM BECAUSE OF THE DETAILS WE WERE ABLE TO GET INTO, IS HOW A SERIOUS DETERIORATION AND EVAPORATION HAS BEEN OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE PRIMARY MILITARY IN THE WORLD TODAY. IT PUTS US IN A DANGER WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN DECADES OF LOSING A CONVENTIONAL WORK, PARTICULARLY WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA. IN THE NEW COMMANDER WHO JUST TOOK OVER THE INDO PACIFIC A FEW WEEKS AGO SAID SOMETHING PRETTY SIMILAR. HE SAID THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WE CAN WIN A WAR AGAINST CHINA TODAY. THOSE ARE ALARMING STATEMENTS MADE BY A SUPERPOWER ON THE UNITED STATES CAPACITY. WE HAVE GOT TO FIX THIS DETERIORATION, AND MUCH OF IT IS IN THE AREA THAT YOU JUST SUGGESTED HAS SUFFERED DECLINED. WE NEED TO GET BACK OUT ON A TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE WHERE WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE, NOT OUR ADVERSARIES. &gt;&gt; Shan EN YOU TALK ABOUT A POTENTIAL LOSS TO RUSSIA OR CHINA, THAT GETS PEOPLE\'S ATTENTION. WE ARE GLAD YOU ARE HERE WITH US. &gt;&gt; HAVE A GOOD THANKSGIVING. &gt;&gt; Shan ANK YOU. KENTUCKY BANS A CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION METHOD, THE ACLU SAYS THE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. KENTUCKY IS TRYING TO SHUT DOWN THE STATE\'S ONLY REMAINING ABORTION CLINIC. YOU WILL HEAR FROM KENTUCKY\'S GOVERNOR. AFTER THE BREAK. AND WILL THE DEMOCRATS TURN DEEP RED MISSISSIPPI BLUE? THE LAST DEBATE OF THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS IS IT TONIGHT. THE RUNOFF FROM MISSISSIPPI\'S U.S. SENATE SEAT IS NEXT TUESDAY AND THE POLLS ARE TIGHTENING THANKS IN PART TO THIS CONTROVERSIAL COMMENT. &gt;&gt; Shan NATOR CINDY HYDE-SMITH ADDRESSES THAT, TONIGHT AND LATER, ALLEGATIONS OF A MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD SCHEME IN LOS ANGELES. THERE EE &gt;&gt; Shan ARE NOW AWAITING A RULING ON AN ABORTION LAW IN KENTUCKY. AT THE STATE\'S ONLY ABORTION CLINIC AND THE ACLU ARE FIGHTING A KENTUCKY LAW THAT BANS A SECOND TRIMESTER ABORTION CALL DILATION AND EXTRACTION. THE ACLU ARGUES THE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. &gt;&gt; THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE ESSENTIALLY A BAN ON ABORTION IN KENTUCKY AFTER A CERTAIN POINT IN PREGNANCY, AND THAT IS GOING TO PUT HEALTH AND LIVES OF KENTUCKY WOMEN AT RISK. &gt;&gt; Shan T\'S BRING IN KENTUCKY\'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, MATT BEVIN, WHO IS BACKING THIS MEASURE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THINK YOU, SHANNON. &gt;&gt; Shan E TRIAL WRAPS UP IN FIVE DAYS, WE ARE WAITING FOR THE JUDGE TO RULE. IN THE MEANTIME, SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IT\'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DISCUSS BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DISMEMBERMENT OF A FETUS AND THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE DOCTORS TO MAKE SURE THE FETUS WAS ACTUALLY DEAD BEFORE THE PROCESS TAKES PLACE. HERE IS WHAT THE ACLU IS SAYING ABOUT THAT, AS WELL. THEY SAY THIS METHOD IS UNFEASIBLE, AND UNRELIABLE. IT REQUIRES ADVANCED TRAINING, PHYSICIANS AND PLAY DO NOT HAVE, AND IN SOME INSTANCE IT REQUIRES PHYSICIANS TO EXPERIMENT ON THEIR PATIENTS AND THAT IS TRULY THE BURDEN THAT THIS LAW WOULD PLACE ON WOMEN. YOUR RESPONSE? &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE. THE IDEA THAT A DOCTOR IS INCAPABLE OF LEARNING HOW TO DO THIS BUT IS BEING GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ABORT THIS CHILD SPEAKS VOLUMES IN AND OF ITSELF. THE DOCTORS ON THE STAND DURING THIS PAST WEEK ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WITH LITERALLY A DAY\'S WORTH OF TRAINING OR LESS, THEY WOULD BE QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR. THIS IS THE ACLU SIMPLY NOT WANTING THERE TO BE ANY OBSTACLES WHATSOEVER TO THIS BRUTAL AND BARBARIC APPROACH TO DISMEMBERING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. IT HAS A BEATING HEART, THIS CHILD HAS A HEART BEAT, BUT IS THEN DISMEMBERED IN THE PROCESS OF KILLING IT. IT IS BARBARIC AND GRUESOME, AND THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE HAVE SAID THAT IN OUR STATE WE THINK THAT IS UNCALLED FOR. THAT\'S SIMPLY WHAT WE ARE DEFENDING, THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE IN KENTUCKY IT IS A LIST WON\'T BE ALLOWED HERE. &gt;&gt; Shan ONG WITH THIS LAW, TWO OF THEIR KENTUCKY LAWS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO LEGAL CASES THAT ARE STILL PENDING, AS WELL. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE CRITICS WHO SAY THAT IT\'S REALLY NOT ABOUT A PARTICULAR METHOD SORT SPECIFIC THINGS THESE LAWS COVER, WHAT IT\'S REALLY ABOUT IS OUTLAWING ABORTIONS? &gt;&gt; THIS IS UNTRUE. ANYONE WHO IS SAYING THAT HAS NOT READ THIS BILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER ABORTION ITSELF IS A LEGAL OR NOT LEGAL, IT SIMPLY SAYS THE METHODOLOGY BY WHICH IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER AN ABORTION CAN BE PERFORMED CANNOT FROM THIS POINT GOING FORWARD, IF THIS BILL IS UPHELD, ALLOW THE DISMEMBERMENT OF A LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE PROCESS OF ABORTING THAT CHILD. IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT THAT CHILD MUST BE KILLED FIRST. IT\'S PREPOSTEROUS, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, SHANNON, THE FACT WE ARE EVEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IS REMARKABLE TO ME. IF THAT VERY SAME CHILD WAS DISCOVERED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF A HEART DYSRHYTHMIA, OR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE FIXED IN A UTERO, THERE WOULD BE AN ANESTHETIC APPLIED AND SURGERY WOULD BE DONE ON THAT SAME CHILD. WHY DO WE APPLY IN ANESTHETIC TO A CHILD IN THE WOMB WHEN PERFORMING SURGERY IF THAT CHILD REALLY FEELS NO PAIN? EVERYONE KNOWS THAT A CHILD FEELS PAIN. IF THE CHILD WAS IN THE WOMB AND WAS KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT, THE PERSON FILED RESPONSIBLE WOULD BE FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF THAT CHILD. SO IT\'S REMARKABLE TO ME THAT IN THIS INSTANCE THE ACLU WANTS TO PRETEND IT\'S NOT A CHILD WHEN LEGALLY IT IS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND PEOPLE KNOW IT FEELS PAIN. &gt;&gt; Shan U KNOW THE DEBATE ON CAPITOL HILL, THE 20 WEEK BAND, WHICH IS THE POINT AT WHICH SUPPORTERS OF THE BELL SITE AN UNBORN FETUS WOULD FEEL PAIN, THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THAT IS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE. THEY DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT. THEY MAY NOT BUY YOUR ARGUMENT. &gt;&gt; ARE MANY WHO THINK IT\'S ACTUALLY LONG BEFORE THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THIS CHILD HAS A HEARTBEAT, THE FACT THAT IT REACTS LITERALLY TO POKE AND/OR PRODS, IF YOU SEE TWINS, AND MY WIFE AND I HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO TWINS AND WE HAVE SEEN THE TWINS INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AT A VERY, VERY YOUNG AGE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, THERE IS NO QUESTION CHILDREN FEEL IN THE WOMB THE EXACT POINT AT WHICH SOME WOULD SAY IT\'S WELL BEFORE 20 WEEKS. THERE ARE VERY FEW CREDIBLE PEOPLE I HAVE EVER HEARD OF THAT DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT A CHILD FEELS PAIN AFTER 20 WEEKS. AND IF, IN FACT, THAT IS THE CASE, WHY DO THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE ADVOCATE TO APPLY AN ANESTHETIC WHEN PERFORMING SURGERY IN THE WOMB? WHY WOULD WE WASTE THE TIME AND MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IF THERE WAS NO PAIN INVOLVED? &gt;&gt; Shan KNOW THERE ARE VERY HEATED CRITICS AND OPPONENTS AND SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL IN KENTUCKY. WE WILL WATCH AND WAIT AS YOU DO FOR THE JUDGE\'S RULING. IN THE MEANTIME, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, GOVERNOR PAIR GOVERNOR. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; Shan OSECUTORS SAY THEY HAVE UNCOVERED A WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD SCHEME IN LOS ANGELES, AND IT\'S ALL BASED ON BRIBING HOMELESS PEOPLE TO FALSIFY VOTING DOCUMENTS. ALL THAT AND MORE WITH TONIGHT\'S POWER PANEL. ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; Shan IS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT, THE TRIAL OF A MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING A NEW YORK CITY WOMAN WHO WAS SEXUALLY ATTACKED WHILE JOGGING HAS ENDED IN A HUNG JURY. THE JUDGE GRANTING A MISTRIAL AFTER JUST A DAY AND A HALF OF DELIBERATION. JENNA LEWIS WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING A WOMAN AS SHE RAN IN QUEENS. THE DNA REPORTEDLY MATCHED HIS PROFILE AND THE JURY SAW HIS VIDEOTAPED CONFESSION. THE JUDGE CLAIMED THAT THE DNA EVIDENCE WAS SUSPECT. TONIGHT, THE L.A.P.D. HAS UD A LARGE SCALE VOTER SCAM. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, SHANNON. THIS IS ALL PART OF A CRACKDOWN ON VOTER FRAUD THAT THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT BEGAN A LONG PRIOR TO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. INVESTIGATORS DISCOVERED THAT THE HOME HOMELESS PEOPLE ON L.A L.A.\'S INFAMOUS SKID ROW WERE GIVEN A DOLLAR OR CIGARETTES IN EXCHANGE FOR PAUL SIGNATURES ON BALLOT PETITIONS. IN THE WORDS OF L.A.P.D. OFFICER, THEY PAID INDIVIDUALS TO ASSIGN NAMES. THAT\'S AN ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY. THE SIGNATURES WERE MOST COMMONLY USED TO GET CERTAIN PROPOSITION ONTO ELECTION BALLOTS. IT\'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES FALSELY GATHERED WERE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN ANY ONE PROPOSITION IT ONTO THE BALLOT IN THIS YEAR\'S MIDTERMS. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW, ANY STATEWIDE PROPOSITION NEEDS AROUND 365,000 SIGNATURES BEFORE IT CAN BE PUT TO VOTERS, AND AN L.A. COUNTY INITIATIVE, JUST UNDER 300,000. PEOPLE HIRED TO GET INITIATIVES ON THE BALLOT WERE OFTEN PAID PER TICK MAJOR, TYPICALLY $1 OR $2, ALTHOUGH THE RATE CAN BE AS HIGH AS $6 PER SIGNATURE. OFFICIALS SAY THOSE INVOLVED IN THIS GAME WERE FINANCIALLY NOT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. THE HEAD OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY ELECTIONS TOLD THE \"LOS ANGELES TIMES,\" IT IS NOT REALLY VOTER FRAUD IN TERMS OF ILLEGAL VOTING AND MANIPULATION, BUT I AM CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ACTIVITY THAT CAUSES A VOTERS TO LOSE FAITH IN THE PROCESS. NINE PEOPLE HAVE NOW BEEN CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCHEME. THEY RANGE IN AGE FROM 28 TO 62, AND EACH COULD FACE FIVE TO SIX YEARS IN PRISON IF CONVICTED. SHANNON? &gt;&gt; Shan NATHAN HUNT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FROM VOTER FRAUD TO VOTER SUPPRESSION, DEMOCRATS IN GEORGIA CONTINUE TO CLAIM VOTER REGISTRATION LAWS AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT COST THEM THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE. TIME NOW FOR TONIGHT POWER PANEL. FORMER OHIO SENATE MINORITY LEADER, COULD BREAK APART. SIENNA CALDWELL AND HOST OF FOX NATION, WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING. &gt;&gt; Shan WILL DO A LIGHTNING ROD SO WE CAN COVER A LOT OF TOPICS TONIGHT. I WANT TO START WITH THE ISSUE THAT JONATHAN WAS JUST REPORTING ABOUT ABOUT THIS FRAUD IN LOS ANGELES. THE \"LOS ANGELES TIMES\" SAID USING CASH AND CIGARETTES AS LEWIS, THE DEFENDANTS APPROACHED HOMELESS PEOPLE ON SKID ROW AND ASKED THEM TO FORGE SIGNATURES ON BALLOT PETITIONS AND VOTER REGISTRATION FORMS. TODD, START WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT LOS ANGELES LOOKS LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY WITH ALL THOSE TENTS IN THE STREET BECAUSE OF THE DEMOCRAT REGIME OVER THERE, IT\'S REALLY NO SURPRISE HERE THAT YOU HAVE VOTER FRAUD. LOOK, WE\'VE BEEN HEARING REPORTS ABOUT THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS, THEY HAVEN\'T SAID WHO THEY WERE SUPPORTING, TURN OUT TO BE DEMOCRATS. &gt;&gt; Shan LL, WE DO OFTEN HEAR THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD. &gt;&gt; THAT\'S A COMPLETE LIE. I\'M ACTUALLY IN CHICAGO RIGHT NOW, WHICH HAS A WELL-DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF VOTER CORRUPTION. LET\'S LOOK AT THE HISTORY, COMPILED AT A DATABASE, EVIDENCE OF ALMOST 1200 VOTER FRAUD CASES AND OF THEM, 1,000 OF THEM RESULTED IN CRIMINAL CONVICTION. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ELECTED OFFICIALS, DEMOCRATS, MOSTLY, WHO SAY VOTER FRAUD DOESN\'T EXIST, THAT\'S A THING OF THE PAST, WE SEE THAT THE EVIDENCE PROVES OTHERWISE. I THINK WE SHOULD BE TELLING EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Shan AT DO YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN \"VOTER FRAUD\" OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THIS IS FRAUD BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY VOTER FRAUD. IT IS FRAUD IN THE COLLECTION OF SIGNATURES, IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE SEEN ON THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2004 WHEN ACORN, PEOPLE WERE GETTING PAID TO COLLECT SIGNATURES, THIS IS VERY SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA. AS SOMEONE WHO SERVED AT THE STATE LEVEL IN OHIO, WHEN I WAS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL MODERNIZATION COMMISSION BACK IN THE BUCKEYE STATE, WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT REALLY IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO. ESSENTIALLY, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR THEIR GOVERNING RIGHTS THE PEOPLE ENTIRELY WITH THESE INITIATIVE PETITIONS, AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE. THESE FOLKS ARE GETTING PAID WITH CIGARETTES AND BOOZE AND WHATEVER ELSE TO GO COLLECT SIGNATURES BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT. RATHER THAN ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HAVING DELIBERATION IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND THAT IS WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY EFFECTIVE, AND THAT\'S EXACTLY WHY. &gt;&gt; Shan T\'S TALK ABOUT GEORGIA. I\'M GOING TO GO ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE THEREFORE GOVERNOR, STACY ABRAMS, DID NOT CONCEDE BUT SHE SAYS LEGALLY SHE RECOGNIZES THAT BRIAN KEMP IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. HERE\'S WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF GEORGIANS WHO WERE PURGED FROM THE ROLLS. BRIAN KEMP OVERSAW FOR EIGHT YEARS THE SYSTEMATIC AND SYSTEMIC DISMANTLING OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THAT MEANS THERE CANNOT BE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN GEORGIA THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; Shan LK? &gt;&gt; THIS WOMAN DISGUSTS ME, TO BE PERFECTLY BLUNT ABOUT IT. WHAT SHE AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IS TRY TO SMEAR EVERY VOTER, GOD-FEARING VOTER IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. SHE KNOWS VERY WELL THAT THE LOCAL COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UPKEEP AND FOR THE LOCAL VOTES. IT IS NOT BRIAN KEMP\'S RESPONSIBILITY. SHE IS EITHER IGNORANT OF THE FACTS OR SHE IS A FLAT OUT LYING. EITHER ONE IS UNACCEPTABLE SHE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF. &gt;&gt; WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO HER, SHANNON, IT SOUNDS LIKE A SORE LOSER. SHE IS VERY MUCH AWARE THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS UPHELD THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN THEM A SIX-YEAR PERIOD FOR THE VOTERS TO VOTE OR WHEN THEY STILL LIVE AT THAT ADDRESS, THEY SIGN AND SEND THEM BACK. THIS ISN\'T SOMETHING THAT IS AN ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY, AS STACY ABRAMS HAS A SUGGESTION APPEAR &gt;&gt; Shan IS CAME FROM OHIO. IF YOU DIDN\'T VOTE IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ELECTIONS, THEY WILL SEND OUT A CARD SAYING, DO YOU STILL LIVE HERE, IS THIS YOUR ADDRESS? AND IF THAT WAS NOT RETURN, YOU WERE WIPED OFF THE ROLLS. IT WASN\'T OVERNIGHT. I WANT TO READ SOMETHING FROM \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" IN A PIECE THEY HEADLINED \"DEMOCRACY SUCCEEDS IN GEORGIA,\" THEY SAY IF MR. KEMP WAS TRYING TO SUPPRESS VOTERS, HE DID A LOUSY JOB. GEORGIA VOTER ROLLS HAVE SWELLED SINCE 2010, AND EXPANSION IN ONLINE REGISTRATION. VOTER TURNOUT WAS UP 14%, WHICH IS EVEN GREATER THAN THE 12.6 INCREASE NATIONWIDE. EARLY VOTING ALSO DOUBLED SINCE 2014 AND THEY INCLUDED WITH THIS, BY ALL EVIDENCE, STACY ABRAMS BENEFITED FROM THIS SURGE IN TURNOUT. &gt;&gt; SURE, I THINK SOME OF THIS IS A BIT OF A POLITICAL NARRATIVE. FOR STACY ABRAMS TO CATCH HERSELF FOR A FUTURE ELECTION AND WRAP HERSELF IN SOMETHING THAT MAY BENEFIT HER FOR THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, FOR EXAMPLE. REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS VOTER SUPPRESSION, SO TO SPEAK. BUT I DO THINK IT WAS SOMEWHAT STRATEGIC BECAUSE WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR I THINK WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC RECOUNT, THERE WERE 20,000 UNCOUNTED PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH VOTER SUPPRESSION, BUT THERE WERE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING THAT BASICALLY AS MANY AS THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC RECOUNT. I THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO HOLD ON AND MAYBE THEY OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND. &gt;&gt; Shan LITERALLY NEED TEN SECONDS EACH FROM YOU GUYS ABOUT THIS MISSISSIPPI RUNOFF NEXT WEEK. IT\'S A VERY IMPORTANT SEAT FOR WHAT\'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE THE U.S. SENATE. CINDY HYDE-SMITH OBVIOUSLY TRIGGERING A LOT OF CONTROVERSY BY MAKING A STATEMENT THAT ONE OF HER SUPPORTERS, SHE WAS SUCH A FAN OF HIS, IF HE INVITED HER TO A PUBLIC HANGING, SHE WOULD BE IN THE FRONT ROW. THAT CAME UP TONIGHT IN A PUBLIC DEBATE. VERY QUICKLY, LET\'S GO ON THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. YOUR REACTION TO THIS RACE. &gt;&gt; TERRIBLE, WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MISSISSIPPI BUT THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS HANGING IN THE PALACE, AND THE WIDE-E OR THE BALLOT, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE SENATE WILL STAY IN REPUBLICAN HANDS BUT I\'M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE COMMENT, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE HISTORY OF MISSISSIPPI. &gt;&gt; Shan DD, CLOSE US OUT OUT. &gt;&gt; SHANNON, I\'VE GOT FAMILY IN MISSISSIPPI AND A SWEET LORD ALMIGHTY. SHE WAS THE DEMOCRAT BACK IN 2010, WHAT CAN I SAY? &gt;&gt; Shan IS GOING TO HANG IT THERE. ALL RIGHT, HAVE A GREAT THANKSGIVING. A FLORIDA SCHOOL DISTRICT EMBROILED IN A TRANSGENDER POLICY DEBATE. A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER ALLEGEDLY TOLD HE HAS TO SUPERVISE A BIOLOGICALLY FEMALE STUDENT WHO NOW IDENTIFIES AS MALE IN THE BOYS LOCKER ROOM. HE SAID HE WAS EJECTED AND HE WAS TOLD HE COULD COST HIM HIS JOB AND MAYBE HIS TEACHING LICENSE. WE ARE HERE NEXT WITH THE STORY.', 'RARE, MEDIUM, OR DONE WELL.

DENNIS WEIMANN WITH THE NEWS, STACY CHRISTENSON WITH THE WEATHER, AND AJ FELDMAN WITH YOUR SPORTS. &gt;&gt; DEN , EVERYONE. THANKS FOR JOINING US. A MINNESOTA ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE HAS RULED THAT A FORMER CANDIDATE FOR BEMIDJI CITY COUNCIL MUST PAY A FINE OF $500 FOR VIOLATING A MINNESOTA STATUTE THAT PROHIBITS ACCEPTING A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION IN EXCESS OF $600 FROM A COMMITTEE. BEMIDJI RECENT DEBIT ROBERT SAXTON HAD FILED THE CAMPAIGN COMPLAINT AGAINST DON HEINONEN ON OCTOBER 24th UNDER THE FAIR CAMPAIGN PRACTICES ACT. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE BARBARA J. CASE RULED ON NOVEMBER 5th THAT THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE IN THE CASE AND HEINONEN FILED A WRITTEN SUBMISSION ON NOVEMBER 7th IN WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE VIOLATION. THE VIOLATION REVOLVED AROUND A MINNESOTA STATUTE WHICH PROHIBITS CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE WHOSE TERRITORY HAS A POPULATION OF 100,000 OR LESS FROM ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR COMMITTEE IN EXCESS OF $600 IN AN ELECTION YEAR. THE CITY OF BEMIDJI HAS A POPULATION OF LESS THAN 100,000. THOMPSON RULED THAT THE DEFINITION OF COMMITTEE APPEARED TO BE BROAD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO EQUALLY DIVIDED COST OF A WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES FOR HEINONEN\'S CAMPAIGN. HEINONEN WAS SEEKING A POSITION ON THE BEMIDJI CITY COUNCIL BUT LOST BY 35 VOTES IN THE NOVEMBER 8th ELECTION TO FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER JIM THOMPSON. &gt;&gt; DEN MIDJI\'S RAILROAD CORRIDOR PROJECT WAS NEARLY DERAILED MONDAY NIGHT DURING THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING WHEN THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO FUNDING. OUR JOSH PETERSON EXPLAINS THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS. &gt;&gt; FOR YEARS, MIDGE EMERGENCY\'S RRP CORRIDOR HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, AND NOW THE PROJECT HAS COME TO A POINT WHERE TIME IS RUNNING OUT IF THEY WISH TO MEET AN UPCOMING DEADLINE. &gt;&gt; WE\'RE AT A STAGE RIGHT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW WE WANT TO PROCEED AHEAD WITH THIS PROJECT. &gt;&gt; WHILE THE CITY HAS CONTRACTED WITH THE ST. PAUL PORT AUTHORITY TO HELP REDEVELOP THE LAND, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AS THERE IS A LOOMING DEADLINE FOR NECESSARY GRANTS. &gt;&gt; THIS SEEMS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US WITH SOME ASSISTANCE TO ACTUALLY GET THIS LOCATION CLEANED UP AND, YOU KNOW, DO SOME REDEVELOPMENT. &gt;&gt; THE PHASES WOULD INCLUDE A NEEDED REVIEW OF THE LAND, WHICH WOULD COST OVER $320,000. THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO FUNDING AND HOW TO PAY FOR THE NEXT STEPS WHEN THERE\'S A CITY-WIDE INFRASTRUCTURE NEED ON THE HORIZON. &gt;&gt; I DON\'T SUPPORT THIS, BECAUSE IT\'S A 320,000-DOLLAR INCIDENT, AND IT GAVE US AN ANSWER, AND THERE WERE MORE DOLLARS TO HAVE TO BE COMMITTED. WE\'RE JUST OPENING THE DOOR. &gt;&gt; YOU\'RE LOOKING AT NUMBERS HERE THAT I CAN\'T SUPPORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE GOING ON. &gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS WISH TO WAIT. &gt;&gt; MAYBE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT NUMBER OUT THERE WOULD BE EASIER FOR SOME OF US TO SWALLOW. &gt;&gt; SO RIGHT NOW, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY PULLED MY HORNS IN 100% ON THIS. IT\'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY AND FADE, BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE DELAYED. &gt;&gt; IN BEMIDJI, JOSH PETERSON, LAKELAND NEWS. &gt;&gt; DEN E TOPIC WAS TABLED TO PROVIDE FURTHER REVIEW OF THE PROJECT AND TO PROVIDE COUNCIL COUNSELMEMBERS WHO WERE NOT IN ATTENDANCE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. &gt;&gt; DEN MAN WHO DIED WHILE DEER HUBTING, IN AITKIN COUNTY OVER THE WEEKEND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 56-YEAR-OLD GREGORY J. NASE OF COLUMBUS. ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF\'S OFFICE, NASE WAS HUNTING WITH HIS FAMILY ON FAMILY OWNED LAND ABOUT SIX MILES NORTHEAST OF MCGRATH. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FAMILY WAS HUNTING TOGETHER, MAKING A DEER DRIVE FOR A WOUNDED DEER. SHOTS WERE REPORTEDLY FIRED AT A MOVING DEER WITH SHOTS STRIKING NASE. NASE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE. THE INCIDENT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE AITKIN COUNTY SHERIFF\'S OFFICE AND THE MINNESOTA B CRMENT A. BCA. &gt;&gt;&gt; AMERICANS ARE BEING ASKED TO NOT EAT ANY ROMAINE LETTUCE. THE REASON? THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION SAYS IT\'S DUE TO E.COLI CONCERNS. THE CDC SAYS 32 PEOPLE IN 11 STATES HAVE BEEN INFECTED. ANOTHER 18 HAVE FALLEN ILL FROM THE SAME STRAIN IN TWO CANADIAN PROVINCES. SINCE NO COMMON GROWER, SUPPLIER, DISTRIBUTOR OR COMPANY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF THE OUTBREAK, THE CDC IS ADVISING ALL AMERICANS TO THROW OUT ANY ROMAINE LETTUCE THEY HAVE AT HOME. &gt;&gt; DEN GROUP OF BEMIDJI HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI ARE KEEPING THE MEMORIES OF THE OLD BEMIDJI HIGH SCHOOL ALIVE WITH A NEW RESTORATION PROJECT.

DENNIS WEIMANN WITH THE NEWS, STACY CHRISTENSON WITH THE WEATHER, AND AJ FELDMAN WITH YOUR SPORTS. &gt;&gt; DEN , EVERYONE. THANKS FOR JOINING US. A MINNESOTA ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE HAS RULED THAT A FORMER CANDIDATE FOR BEMIDJI CITY COUNCIL MUST PAY A FINE OF $500 FOR VIOLATING A MINNESOTA STATUTE THAT PROHIBITS ACCEPTING A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION IN EXCESS OF $600 FROM A COMMITTEE. BEMIDJI RECENT DEBIT ROBERT SAXTON HAD FILED THE CAMPAIGN COMPLAINT AGAINST DON HEINONEN ON OCTOBER 24th UNDER THE FAIR CAMPAIGN PRACTICES ACT. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE BARBARA J. CASE RULED ON NOVEMBER 5th THAT THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE IN THE CASE AND HEINONEN FILED A WRITTEN SUBMISSION ON NOVEMBER 7th IN WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE VIOLATION. THE VIOLATION REVOLVED AROUND A MINNESOTA STATUTE WHICH PROHIBITS CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE WHOSE TERRITORY HAS A POPULATION OF 100,000 OR LESS FROM ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR COMMITTEE IN EXCESS OF $600 IN AN ELECTION YEAR. THE CITY OF BEMIDJI HAS A POPULATION OF LESS THAN 100,000. THOMPSON RULED THAT THE DEFINITION OF COMMITTEE APPEARED TO BE BROAD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO EQUALLY DIVIDED COST OF A WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES FOR HEINONEN\'S CAMPAIGN. HEINONEN WAS SEEKING A POSITION ON THE BEMIDJI CITY COUNCIL BUT LOST BY 35 VOTES IN THE NOVEMBER 8th ELECTION TO FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER JIM THOMPSON. &gt;&gt; DEN MIDJI\'S RAILROAD CORRIDOR PROJECT WAS NEARLY DERAILED MONDAY NIGHT DURING THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING WHEN THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO FUNDING. OUR JOSH PETERSON EXPLAINS THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS. &gt;&gt; FOR YEARS, MIDGE EMERGENCY\'S RRP CORRIDOR HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, AND NOW THE PROJECT HAS COME TO A POINT WHERE TIME IS RUNNING OUT IF THEY WISH TO MEET AN UPCOMING DEADLINE. &gt;&gt; WE\'RE AT A STAGE RIGHT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW WE WANT TO PROCEED AHEAD WITH THIS PROJECT. &gt;&gt; WHILE THE CITY HAS CONTRACTED WITH THE ST. PAUL PORT AUTHORITY TO HELP REDEVELOP THE LAND, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AS THERE IS A LOOMING DEADLINE FOR NECESSARY GRANTS. &gt;&gt; THIS SEEMS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US WITH SOME ASSISTANCE TO ACTUALLY GET THIS LOCATION CLEANED UP AND, YOU KNOW, DO SOME REDEVELOPMENT. &gt;&gt; THE PHASES WOULD INCLUDE A NEEDED REVIEW OF THE LAND, WHICH WOULD COST OVER $320,000. THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO FUNDING AND HOW TO PAY FOR THE NEXT STEPS WHEN THERE\'S A CITY-WIDE INFRASTRUCTURE NEED ON THE HORIZON. &gt;&gt; I DON\'T SUPPORT THIS, BECAUSE IT\'S A 320,000-DOLLAR INCIDENT, AND IT GAVE US AN ANSWER, AND THERE WERE MORE DOLLARS TO HAVE TO BE COMMITTED. WE\'RE JUST OPENING THE DOOR. &gt;&gt; YOU\'RE LOOKING AT NUMBERS HERE THAT I CAN\'T SUPPORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE GOING ON. &gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS WISH TO WAIT. &gt;&gt; MAYBE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT NUMBER OUT THERE WOULD BE EASIER FOR SOME OF US TO SWALLOW. &gt;&gt; SO RIGHT NOW, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY PULLED MY HORNS IN 100% ON THIS. IT\'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY AND FADE, BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE DELAYED. &gt;&gt; IN BEMIDJI, JOSH PETERSON, LAKELAND NEWS. &gt;&gt; DEN E TOPIC WAS TABLED TO PROVIDE FURTHER REVIEW OF THE PROJECT AND TO PROVIDE COUNCIL COUNSELMEMBERS WHO WERE NOT IN ATTENDANCE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. &gt;&gt; DEN MAN WHO DIED WHILE DEER HUBTING, IN AITKIN COUNTY OVER THE WEEKEND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 56-YEAR-OLD GREGORY J.

BCA. &gt;&gt;&gt; AMERICANS ARE BEING ASKED TO NOT EAT ANY ROMAINE LETTUCE. THE REASON? THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION SAYS IT\'S DUE TO E.COLI CONCERNS. THE CDC SAYS 32 PEOPLE IN 11 STATES HAVE BEEN INFECTED. ANOTHER 18 HAVE FALLEN ILL FROM THE SAME STRAIN IN TWO CANADIAN PROVINCES. SINCE NO COMMON GROWER, SUPPLIER, DISTRIBUTOR OR COMPANY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF THE OUTBREAK, THE CDC IS ADVISING ALL AMERICANS TO THROW OUT ANY ROMAINE LETTUCE THEY HAVE AT HOME. &gt;&gt; DEN GROUP OF BEMIDJI HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI ARE KEEPING THE MEMORIES OF THE OLD BEMIDJI HIGH SCHOOL ALIVE WITH A NEW RESTORATION PROJECT.

us why despite his critics Trump had no choice but first the witch hunt that\'s been going on forever no collusion no nothing they\'ve been finished finish them yesterday the lawyers have them I assume they\'ll tournament today or soon well shortly after the president delivered that statement on his way to Mar Lago it was indeed confirmed that the president and his attorneys officially responded to Special Counsel Robert Muller\'s team the president\'s lawyer Rudy Giuliani adding and I quote it\'s been our position from the outset that much of what\'s been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry this remains our position today in quote so is this probe now finally finally on its last legs for more on what the White House is thinking tonight we go live to Kevin cork who\'s traveling with the president in Palm Beach Kevin I know you\'re suffering down there in Palm Beach tell us what\'s up yeah what are you gonna do about it governor hey great to be with you and wonderful to have you on the program happy Thanksgiving to you and certainly your family I can just tell you this the White House remains resolute and determined that this probe is going to end one way or the other sooner preferably then later I can also tell you that they continue to insist that there was never ever any Russian collusion and we\'ve talked about that at length and so the obvious question becomes now what happens as we move into the next phase with this special council the ball is clearly in Robert Muller\'s court and they\'re frankly governor are a number of different directions he could choose to go in because despite the White House\'s frustration this probe will continue until it reaches a natural and or the acting AG puts the brakes on it so the question becomes where do we go from here well the Muller team could review the president\'s answers that you just talked about and they could simply ask for more information they could review those answers again and then prepare to simply disclose the report that we all figure is just about wrapped up they could meanwhile compare his answers with other respondents and that\'s where things can get a little interesting if not 40 and then ultimately the nuclear option they could choose to subpoena the press of the United States now let\'s be clear about this governor sources tell Fox News that while the president\'s legal team remains open and I\'m using air quotes to a possible sit down with the special counsel no one repeat no one believes that will happen without a subpoena and even if it were to happen I don\'t think there\'s any question it would spark a constitutional crisis something we\'ll be keeping a very close eye on but for now enjoy the holiday week Mike back to you thanks Kevin and you enjoy your Thanksgiving as well even in Palm Beach well here with more attorney John Salley service special assistant counsel at the Watergate trial he was under Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski also with me Juan Williams Fox News political analyst and co-host of the five and Dan bond Gino former Secret Service agent and host on NRA TV John I want to start with you we\'ve got these answers now they\'ve been submitted is there a timeline that you can sort of give us a insight into well nobody has a timeline but I think I put its foot in context I don\'t think and I argued in an article I wrote in the hill I don\'t think that the special counsel is entitled to any answers from a person they\'re investigating I mean I represent people all the time who are being investigated we never give a statement and prosecutors do their job they continue a thorough investigation they draw the conclusions without the benefit of answers from the person they\'re investigating I think they\'re getting more than they ordinarily would and in this case they can write a report the office of legal counsel has said they cannot indict the president so after over a year after over a million documents after I think it\'s 35 witnesses where the president did not assert any privilege is it a time for them to write their report and let the court of public opinion decide whether or not there was collusion okay so why do you want to give me the contrarian opinion as to why this ought to just keep going on and on and on like the Energizer Bunny for heaven\'s sakes no Mike I I\'m all for wrapping up obviously this is not of the length that so in terms of prior prosecutors investigating presidents those go on for five years or more so we\'re coming up on two years here and so I don\'t think that\'s a that\'s the reason although I would prefer given that we\'re going to see a lot of you know excitement around the 2020 election that somehow this get out of the way I prefer that I will say that I was taken aback by the effort by Rudy Giuliani the president\'s lawyer to limit the scope of the investigation by saying we\'re not going to answer any questions about obstruction now I heard you know what was being said about hey you don\'t have to answer anything that\'s fine but the president has long said he has nothing to hide and then the later issue is that the New York Times today broke a story saying the president was suggesting to the White House Counsel that somehow the Department of Justice go after Jim Comey go after Hillary Clinton in other words punish his political opponents boy that sure seems shady that sure seems like obstruction I don\'t know anything about what\'s in the Mullah report obviously I don\'t know about collusion I don\'t have any evidence of that in front of me but boy that sure strikes me as a man who\'s trying to obstruct an investigation because he worries that he\'s in deep water yeah Dan you know if that happened that would my gosh it would be almost as bad as when Obama went after people through the IRS in the Justice Department and when he had wiretaps on James Rosen and his parents and The Associated Press and and to once point about the limitation of the investigation let\'s talk about that a minute because as I recall the only thing that was supposed to be investigated was whether or not Donald Trump colluded with Russia that was the limitation of the investigation this thing has continued to go on and on dan I\'d like for you to weigh in and tell me you know if that\'s the limitation isn\'t this about over well I always enjoy the company of my good friend Juan and a new governor but Juana I don\'t know how you said that with a straight face are you seriously making the case that targeting your political opponents which was in that New York Times story is all of a sudden this malicious thing while simultaneously know that Trump team was spied on by the Obama administration one that\'s not to say wait a minute wait what\'s that about we know that in fact when when Trump said there was a liar tap on our know everybody said that\'s not true what one do you know the name Stefan halper he was a Central Intelligence Agency intelligence asset that was utilized against the Trump team you know how I know that one because he actually emailed people in the Trump team the emails I don\'t know if you missed that but that\'s out there that was astir he was outed in the New York Times where they said everything but his name so I just find it bizarre that you would say oh my gosh this is so offensive Trump\'s a alleged to have targeted his political opponents as you completely ignore the fact that the Obama administration actually didn\'t target their political opponents that\'s not open for dispute that actually yeah but dan dan hold on I think what you\'re saying is that when there was and the Obama administration knew of Russia interfering 2016 and you they may have approved somebody saying hey what\'s going on here but that\'s not punishing your political opponents as someone in office acting like an authoritarian like the instruments of criminal justice to go after your political upon listen again I\'m sorry but you\'re just not familiar with the details of the case the Deputy Director of the FBI himself Juan said there would have been no Russian collusion case without the dossier the dossier has been debunked none of that this is nonsense why eventually one yes Dan I have enjoyed this immensely but I want to thank you and John all for being here but I\'ve got to let you go get your turkey cook thank you I\'m kind of turned now to the ongoing battle between CNN and the White House CNN celebrated their legal victory when Jim Acosta got his press pass reinstated but what does it mean for everybody else Byron York writing yesterday said and I quote the Acosta decision could make it easier for White House officials to kick reporters out in quote joining me now to discuss is former White House press secretary and senior advisor to the America first action-packed Sean Spicer along with former Ronald Reagan aide and author of the forthcoming book swamp Wars Jeffrey Lord alright gentlemen let\'s talk about the new rules the White House is laid out for reporters actually will they be followed by Acosta and his colleagues in the press room or is the White House gonna need to come up with a maybe three strikes and you\'re out plan Sean your view on this this new announcement for the White House well governor it\'s great to see I think I talked about this my podcast with Kelly and Conway this is a discussion about content versus conduct and I think there\'s a very capable press secretary that\'s right now able to discern the difference between the two no one has a question about the content of any reporters question they can ask whatever they want but their conduct is it what\'s in question and I think that\'s what the judge ruled the other day will they behave in a way that\'s professional will they respect not just the office of the presidency but their fellow reporters and I think that\'s what this really comes down to I think there\'s a great press secretary now you may know her that knows how to call balls and strikes and there\'s a president that knows how to understand that as well and I think this is what it comes down to and where other organizations no names mentioned but you may guess them are trying to blur the lines is the question about what the content is no one cares what the reporter asks they can ask whatever question they want but the way that these reporters conduct themselves do they conduct themselves and show respect to not only their the fellow reporters but to the president United States and the White House is What\'s in question Jeffrey the judge ruled in a rather narrow way he did not say that the First Amendment was in any way being attacked by Jim Acosta losing his hard pass it was just that the process was not fully maybe visible to the world and therefore his Fifth Amendment issue was the only one but they celebrated as if somehow that they had taken a stand for democracy I don\'t remember any of the mainstream media being really that clever clear and honest about what that ruling was from the judge last week you\'re absolutely right governor and Shaun has hit the nail on the head this is about conduct not about content you know in the last couple days we\'ve heard from major Garrett now with CBS in the Obama days of course he was the White House correspondent for Fox no one remembers major Garrett acting like Jim Acosta it\'s because he didn\'t there was a way to do this shawn has been the the White House press secretary I\'ve been a press secretary to a senator and a congressman before that this is totally unprofessional stuff and I I think that CNN has to be very careful here of what they wish for because now if there are going to be a set of rules and regulations then then the the good press I carry that Sarah is she\'s gonna have to and she will I have no doubt call them out you know one other thing I took a quick look back at a memory from childhood of JFK\'s press conferences where he had adversarial reporters they were so well mannered governor it\'s beyond belief we have gone so far down the path in the wrong direction with this stuff well it\'s almost unbelievable and I think CNN and Jim Acosta will come to regret it so will their compadres in the broom I want to get your thoughts on the fact that the White House Correspondents Association of announced it it\'s not going to have a comedian roast the media next year what\'s known as the annual nerd prom and said they\'re gonna have biographer Ron chernow who\'s going to be the featured speaker to put some perspective on today\'s politics in history last year speaker annie trump comedian michelle wolf tweeted this in response she said and I quote the White House Correspondents Association are cowards the media is complicit and I couldn\'t be prouder in quote first of all I\'m not sure they had a comedian last year they had Michelle wolf and she just wasn\'t funny so Sean what\'s your response to the fact that Correspondents Association for the first time in decades has decided that they\'re not going to have that kind of lack I will say lack of political humor going on I you know what here\'s my response I applaud Olivia Knox in the White House Correspondents Association for doing this they want to have a dinner that celebrates the First Amendment and it actually shows that that\'s what their intent is so I applaud them for it because they last year they wanted to have a comedian and they talked about how this comedian michelle wolf would have would conduct herself and talk about the First Amendment and it wasn\'t it was rude it was disgusting and I think for them to at least acknowledge the fact that they want to talk about the First Amendment and have a historian do it I don\'t know what this individual is going to talk about but I think at least their intent is right and I\'ll give him credit for that because last year\'s dinner was disgusting and what I thought was more appalling about the dinner than anything is that they they branded it as about the First Amendment the comedian if that\'s what you call her wasn\'t that and no one in the White House Correspondents from NBC ABC CBS CNN said anything about the way that this person so-called conducted themselves in the quote spirit of the First Amendment so to see them at least acknowledge that that wasn\'t the right direction is is at least something that I want to applaud and say at least you got the message well we\'ll see how it works out Jeffrey Sean great to have you both happy Thanksgiving - thanks Happy Thanksgiving you bet straight ahead Trump\'s critics are lashing out over his response to Saudi Arabia today in the wake of the killing of journalist Jamal khashoggi up next our panel they\'ll explain why he might have sided with the lesser of two evils the fact is maybe he did maybe did we are with Saudi Arabia we\'re staying with Saudi Arabia and by the way just so everybody I have no business whatsoever with Saudi Arabia it\'s all about for me very simple it\'s America first Saudi Arabia if we broke with them I think your oil prices would go through the roof I\'ve kept them down it\'s a very simple equation for me I\'m about make America great again and I\'m about America first well that was the president earlier today addressing his decision not to further punish Saudi Arabia after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi come on what the White House and the critics are saying tonight let\'s go to Christian Fisher she\'s live from Washington Christin president Trump says that there will be no further repercussions against Saudi Arabia because he believes a good us-saudi relationship is simply more important he\'s putting business opportunities and security alliances over this human rights abuse the murder of journalist Jamal khashoggi now the decision comes despite a report that the CIA believes that the Saudi Crown Prince did order the killing but President Trump said today that he\'s standing by the Saudis and here\'s why I\'m not going to tell a country that\'s spending hundreds of billions of dollars and has helped me do one thing very importantly keep oil prices down so that they\'re not going to a hundred and 150 dollars a barrel I\'m not going to destroy the world economy and I\'m not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia but the president\'s decision is being denounced by members of both parties on Capitol Hill even by some of his closest allies Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said I fully realized we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage however when we lose our moral voice we lose her strongest asset and Senator Rand Paul said I\'m pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia first not America first now in that statement President Trump said to Congress that Congress was free to go in a different direction if it so choose and indeed tonight senator Graham said that he believes that there will be strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia Mike Thank You Kristen joining me now with reaction is Walid Phares the foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump\'s 2016 campaign David to Furi former Obama campaign foreign policy adviser and former State Department official as well as Rebecca Heinrich senior fellow at the Hudson Institute well lead let\'s talk about this good or bad move on the president\'s part I think the president is basically tell us that the national security the high interest of the United States basically tells us that we need to maintain the strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia but at the same time there needs to be an investigation and I think if you want to be fair in America and around the world that investigation should be comprehensive all the way if there are other crimes we\'ve heard that before so I think on the one hand maintaining the strategic relationship with the Saudis to contain the Iranians to make sure that we are continuing the fight against the jihadists and Isis is the right thing to do and the investigation should be separate from politics and go all the way Rebeca it it does seem though that this can\'t just be a binary choice is either the Saudis of the Iranians if somebody does something bad even if they\'re our friends don\'t we need to do something to say that this has got to be seriously dealt with and and the systematic murder of a journalist that\'s pretty serious Mike I think that the president actually is being prudent here it\'s not a binary choice as you said but we have sanctioned the 17 Saudis that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has identified as responsible for cash oh geez murder but the president has decided that we have to look at the context that this falls in and that\'s the security relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia there they\'re a couple of major things we got to keep in mind Saudi Arabia is critically important for the the global energy market even as the United States becomes energy independent our allies still rely on the petroleum that comes from Saudi Arabia and especially as we sanction Iran we need that oil to keep flowing from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia also helps us keep those energy choke points open and so that the Iranians don\'t have a monopoly on those including the Strait of Hormuz and then of course they\'re there helping the United States in in pushing back Iranian aggression generally in the region so that\'s a critical relationship and so I think that the president really thread the needle carefully in balancing human rights concerns of kocho Jews murder and also taking into consideration first and foremost the priority which is the security of Americans David the president Trump\'s not the first president that had a cozy relationship with the Saudis to my knowledge all of the presidents Democrats and Republicans have sometimes I think been too cozy with the Saudis even after 9/11 when we really didn\'t call their hand after the reality was that they were highly connected to the folks who were guilty of 9/11 so it\'s President Trump any different than the other presidents Democrat and Republican who have kind of looked the other way at the atrocities of the Saudis well that\'s a fair criticism against all of our presidents but this was a serious provocation the world is watching to see what America is going to do and what America needs to do is two things we have to send a message to the world that we won\'t tolerate this kind of behavior and there will be repercussions for it at the same time we have to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia because it is important Ally so if to punish them make them say they\'re sorry and make them do the things that show they\'re never going to do this again so other countries also don\'t do it but also preserve that that alliance that\'s important now President Trump was doing an okay job of that but it went off the rails today with his public statements he saw some of them in the previous reporting we also he also put out a written statement it looked like he wrote it himself it starts out saying that the world is a dangerous place that\'s not a way an appropriate way to start a foreign policy statement it sounds like he\'s saying he can\'t protect us from the types of thugs that Saudi Arabia sent to kill this journalist Khashoggi that\'s not appropriate American values are not for sale you heard Trump talking about how it\'s more important that we be able to sell arms to Saudi Arabia then that we stand up for rule of law that we stand up for human rights that\'s not right he needs to go back to the original attacked which is we\'re gonna punish Saudi Arabia but we\'re gonna preserve our relationship with the king but we\'re gonna encourage them to make sure everyone who\'s responsible no habit no matter how high it goes up everyone who is responsible is punished I need some quick answers from each of you let me start Waleed with you what are the president\'s options what should he do if you were whispering in his ear tonight what would you tell him he\'s got to do it\'s very simple on the one hand continue with these investigations we\'ve had investigations in the past like with the killing of the former prime minister of Lebanon Hariri that are 13 years for now so we have to be very serious about these investigations on the one hand the sanctions should target those who are responsible and not engage in geopolitical mistakes by engaging more influence of Iran in Yemen or in other parts of the region so we have to be very careful and distinguishing between the legal process and the geopolitical process Rebecca very quickly just a simple answer yeah does this hurt the president with members of his own party I don\'t think that it should I think the president\'s being completely realistic with the cards that he\'s been dealt he should continue to pressure the Saudis privately and we should continue to hope and to push the the print the young Prince to move towards reforms he\'s shown an interest in having a softening relationship with Israel that\'s a critical ally we need to continue to cultivate that relationship and pressure where we can so that it\'s useful and David does this send a a good or bad message to the Iranians well the Iranians like this right they want to see a division between Saudi Arabia in the US so we have to show we are gonna keep that alliance in place and we are going to continue to confront Iran but we\'re going to curb this kind of conduct by Saudi Arabia let\'s see what our CIA says about who is responsible the president should work with our intelligence agencies and with Congress to come up with a resolution that\'s going to punish Saudi Arabia but preserve the alliance thank you all David well lead Rebecca have a great Thanksgiving painting and coming up should a small handful of leftist judges be making decisions that adversely affect all of America now wait till you hear how an Obama appointed judge just up into the president\'s emergency restrictions on asylum claims that debate coming up next people should not be allowed to immediately run to this very friendly circuit and file their case it\'s a disgrace in my opinion it\'s a disgrace what happens with the Ninth Circuit well you go to the ninth circuit and it\'s a disgrace and I\'m going to put in a major complaint because you cannot win if you\'re us a case in the Ninth Circuit and I think it\'s a disgrace this was an Obama judge and I\'ll tell you what it\'s not going to happen like this anymore well that was President Trump taking aim at the liberal 9th Circuit and one judge in particular US District Judge John s.tiger who was nominated by President Obama back in 2012 judge tiger issued a nationwide injunction against Trump\'s newly announced emergency restrictions on asylum claims this means anyone seeking asylum can do it anywhere they want that\'s instead of the ports of entry that the Trump administration sought to restricted to the debate this topic is Francisco Hernandez immigration attorney and art Arthur from the Center for Immigration Studies all right let\'s start with you this is basically saying I\'ll come on in any way that you can I mean that seems a little dangerous to sort of change the rules of how people seeking asylum get into the country well it\'s the danger that Judge tiger actually ignores and in fact he seems to be completely unaware of the dangers that exist for people who enter the United States illegally 68% of all of those individuals who are assaulted during that trip one-third of all women are sexually assaulted during the trip through Mexico to the United States to enter illegally what the Trump administration has attempted to do is dissuade individuals from entering the United States illegally do you have an orderly process by which individuals go to ports of entry and yet for some reason judge Tiger has said that individuals who are entering the United States illegally have some right to enter the United States illegally or at least know that the Trump administration hasn\'t acted properly in constraining them from doing so it\'s absolutely incorrect it\'s not true it happens to be the law if he doesn\'t like it why didn\'t get Congress to do the immigration reform as promised for two years guys hold on hold on if it\'s the law then isn\'t that the law that you have to go through a port of entry isn\'t it the law that if you want to go into a country but that there are processes to legally immigrated and Francisca I believe that there ought to be a legal immigration policy I\'m for immigrant I\'m not against it I\'m even for them for people who are truly endangered but this is not what we\'re talking about we\'re talking about people just showing up so how do you respond to that well because they still have to make a claim past the threshold burden approved to show that there have at least the opportunity for political asylum and the people making the evaluation of whether they have shown that proof or employees of the State Department it doesn\'t mean to get political a sound because they cross in a legal port of entry or a non legal port of entry it doesn\'t matter the proof is the same in the people evaluating or employees of President Trump so it doesn\'t make a difference where they cross they still have to show up they don\'t they don\'t have a right they have a right to apply for asylum but they don\'t have eligibility for asylum and what the Trump administration attempted to do was restrict the ability of individuals who have entered the United States illegally in violation of US law and violate who have committed a crime from applying for asylum they don\'t have the they can\'t come through legally through a port of entry anyway it doesn\'t matter if they line up at the port of entry they\'re not going to be let in anyway until they\'re heard on their political asylum claim by the way Wow absolutely but if they show or the report of entry that we can allow them to enter in an orderly fashion we don\'t have them you know hiring smugglers we don\'t have them hiring the cartels to enter the United States legally yes there might be made really by God limiting the number people in Mexico Francisco Francisco let me ask you this if a person shows up you say it doesn\'t have to be a point of entry just anywhere and they say I need asylum so if that\'s the case yes where are they held until this investigation happens do we let them down freely in the country where where are they held without the criticism that they\'re being held illegally are unlawfully in order for them to make a claim of political asylum they have to go to an immigration official and stake their claims so even if they cross in a non port of entry they still have to go to an immigration official to set out their proof in if they go through a legal port of entry there is no mechanism where they can come in legally anyway that is the misconception that we\'re operating under they cannot wait with them go ahead there\'s no misconception there because they can make it allege they can assert credible fear if they go through a port of entry they\'re found to have a credible fear then they\'re placed in removal proceedings and they can make an application for asylum that\'s exactly what they do with the Trump order says but-but-but the law says it doesn\'t matter where even if they come in from a non illegal port of entry they still have to go to an immigration officer to make their claim for political asylum otherwise they they can never even apply it doesn\'t make a difference excuse me guys shouldn\'t it trouble us all that a judge a single federal judge decides for the entire nation that he\'s going to just up end the elected president\'s policies I think that\'s got to be a little bit we have to go I\'m so sorry we\'ll try to do it Thank You governor next time up next Laura recently spoke to a UC Berkeley student about how she was being targeted for her Christian beliefs this after she dared abstained from a vote on lb g TQ rights now this is a can\'t-miss defending the first segment which is coming up next I don\'t see a conflict between being able to accept love and validate you as an individual and yet not fully agreeing with how you choose identify yourself secondly simply daring to dissent our next guest has had her campus life destroyed isabella chow a student senator at the University of California Berkeley got kicked out of her own party and is being pressured to resign because of her religious views her crime she simply abstained from a largely symbolic student vote on October 31st because she didn\'t fully agree with certain clauses inside the pro lgbtq bills as a result she got labeled homophobic and transphobic even though she didn\'t even oppose the final vote Laura had the opportunity to speak with Isabella earlier let\'s watch take us through the past few weeks we first want to establish what happened this is a student government kind of proclamation stating what exactly yes so the bill the main bill that I abstained from oppose Trump\'s proposed reforms to title nine and specifically one clause where a person\'s gender is defined as a person\'s biological sex now the bill that I abstained from not only did it say you know we support freedom from discrimination and harassment for all individuals and especially LGBTQ individuals but at the end it there were clauses that asked me to promote an LGBTQ identity and lifestyle and to promote organizations the Meuse primary purpose is to promote the LGBTQ identity in lifestyle and I said because of my Christian views and because I represent the Christian community on campus I cannot fully support this bill okay so in for that being a Christian and being unapologetic you were labeled some pretty terrible things The Daily Californian said the following Isabella Chao made transphobic and homophobic statements during an ASUC meeting publicly dismissing the identities of individuals on campus Chow\'s language erased and humanized individuals etc etc how do you respond to that did you demonize people because of your faith yes I\'d actually like to go back to my original statements on the Senate floor on October 31st and what I said was one I think that discrimination and harassment is never ever okay but where I cross a line between you know where I can protect you as an individual and where I can promote your identity is a very fine line for me to walk right and so my response is I don\'t see a conflict between being able to accept love and validate you as an individual and yet not fully agreeing with how you choose identify yourself sexually it\'s a simple I think understanding here they\'re asking you to promote something that is contrary to your fundamental religious beliefs that is requiring you to worship at the altar of something that you don\'t believe in it\'s as simple as that whether it\'s a proclamation or or what you said on October 30th it\'s as simple as that and my problem with this is this is happening across the board in American society if you are a you try to be no one\'s perfect we all fall down but if you try to live your faith and you believe your your faith as I guess stated in the Bible or whatever you view the Bible to be and it\'s contrary to whatever prevailing norm is at at this point popular then you\'re labeled a hater homophobic transphobic any phobic here what comes to mind and they want to shut you down so that now you you are dehumanized so what they\'re accusing you of they are now doing to you requiring you to resign from you know your various positions have no position on campus and be reviled and for that we\'re supposed to give them like two thumbs up I don\'t understand how that\'s diversity today yeah I mean I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve been called the f-word person online social media on the Senate floor and I mean other slurs that I just don\'t want to repeat on camera oh and again when you say look I love all people but this just like you don\'t agree with everything I believe in I don\'t agree with everything you believe in but I love all people I love you

decisions point to a new reality for the media plus the president under siege from critics over his response to the Saudi Arabian killing of Jamaal khashoggi an all-star foreign policy panel will tell us why despite his critics Trump had no choice but first the witch hunt that\'s been going on forever no collusion no nothing they\'ve been finished finish them yesterday the lawyers have them I assume they\'ll tournament today or soon well shortly after the president delivered that statement on his way to Mar Lago it was indeed confirmed that the president and his attorneys officially responded to Special Counsel Robert Muller\'s team the president\'s lawyer Rudy Giuliani adding and I quote it\'s been our position from the outset that much of what\'s been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry this remains our position today in quote so is this probe now finally finally on its last legs for more on what the White House is thinking tonight we go live to Kevin cork who\'s traveling with the president in Palm Beach Kevin I know you\'re suffering down there in Palm Beach tell us what\'s up yeah what are you gonna do about it governor hey great to be with you and wonderful to have you on the program happy Thanksgiving to you and certainly your family I can just tell you this the White House remains resolute and determined that this probe is going to end one way or the other sooner preferably then later I can also tell you that they continue to insist that there was never ever any Russian collusion and we\'ve talked about that at length and so the obvious question becomes now what happens as we move into the next phase with this special council the ball is clearly in Robert Muller\'s court and they\'re frankly governor are a number of different directions he could choose to go in because despite the White House\'s frustration this probe will continue until it reaches a natural and or the acting AG puts the brakes on it so the question becomes where do we go from here well the Muller team could review the president\'s answers that you just talked about and they could simply ask for more information they could review those answers again and then prepare to simply disclose the report that we all figure is just about wrapped up they could meanwhile compare his answers with other respondents and that\'s where things can get a little interesting if not 40 and then ultimately the nuclear option they could choose to subpoena the press of the United States now let\'s be clear about this governor sources tell Fox News that while the president\'s legal team remains open and I\'m using air quotes to a possible sit down with the special counsel no one repeat no one believes that will happen without a subpoena and even if it were to happen I don\'t think there\'s any question it would spark a constitutional crisis something we\'ll be keeping a very close eye on but for now enjoy the holiday week Mike back to you thanks Kevin and you enjoy your Thanksgiving as well even in Palm Beach well here with more attorney John Salley service special assistant counsel at the Watergate trial he was under Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski also with me Juan Williams Fox News political analyst and co-host of the five and Dan bond Gino former Secret Service agent and host on NRA TV John I want to start with you we\'ve got these answers now they\'ve been submitted is there a timeline that you can sort of give us a insight into well nobody has a timeline but I think I put its foot in context I don\'t think and I argued in an article I wrote in the hill I don\'t think that the special counsel is entitled to any answers from a person they\'re investigating I mean I represent people all the time who are being investigated we never give a statement and prosecutors do their job they continue a thorough investigation they draw the conclusions without the benefit of answers from the person they\'re investigating I think they\'re getting more than they ordinarily would and in this case they can write a report the office of legal counsel has said they cannot indict the president so after over a year after over a million documents after I think it\'s 35 witnesses where the president did not assert any privilege is it a time for them to write their report and let the court of public opinion decide whether or not there was collusion okay so why do you want to give me the contrarian opinion as to why this ought to just keep going on and on and on like the Energizer Bunny for heaven\'s sakes no Mike I I\'m all for wrapping up obviously this is not of the length that so in terms of prior prosecutors investigating presidents those go on for five years or more so we\'re coming up on two years here and so I don\'t think that\'s a that\'s the reason although I would prefer given that we\'re going to see a lot of you know excitement around the 2020 election that somehow this get out of the way I prefer that I will say that I was taken aback by the effort by Rudy Giuliani the president\'s lawyer to limit the scope of the investigation by saying we\'re not going to answer any questions about obstruction now I heard you know what was being said about hey you don\'t have to answer anything that\'s fine but the president has long said he has nothing to hide and then the later issue is that the New York Times today broke a story saying the president was suggesting to the White House Counsel that somehow the Department of Justice go after Jim Comey go after Hillary Clinton in other words punish his political opponents boy that sure seems shady that sure seems like obstruction I don\'t know anything about what\'s in the Mullah report obviously I don\'t know about collusion I don\'t have any evidence of that in front of me but boy that sure strikes me as a man who\'s trying to obstruct an investigation because he worries that he\'s in deep water yeah Dan you know if that happened that would my gosh it would be almost as bad as when Obama went after people through the IRS in the Justice Department and when he had wiretaps on James Rosen and his parents and The Associated Press and and to once point about the limitation of the investigation let\'s talk about that a minute because as I recall the only thing that was supposed to be investigated was whether or not Donald Trump colluded with Russia that was the limitation of the investigation this thing has continued to go on and on dan I\'d like for you to weigh in and tell me you know if that\'s the limitation isn\'t this about over well I always enjoy the company of my good friend Juan and a new governor but Juana I don\'t know how you said that with a straight face are you seriously making the case that targeting your political opponents which was in that New York Times story is all of a sudden this malicious thing while simultaneously know that Trump team was spied on by the Obama administration one that\'s not to say wait a minute wait what\'s that about we know that in fact when when Trump said there was a liar tap on our know everybody said that\'s not true what one do you know the name Stefan halper he was a Central Intelligence Agency intelligence asset that was utilized against the Trump team you know how I know that one because he actually emailed people in the Trump team the emails I don\'t know if you missed that but that\'s out there that was astir he was outed in the New York Times where they said everything but his name so I just find it bizarre that you would say oh my gosh this is so offensive Trump\'s a alleged to have targeted his political opponents as you completely ignore the fact that the Obama administration actually didn\'t target their political opponents that\'s not open for dispute that actually yeah but dan dan hold on I think what you\'re saying is that when there was and the Obama administration knew of Russia interfering 2016 and you they may have approved somebody saying hey what\'s going on here but that\'s not punishing your political opponents as someone in office acting like an authoritarian like the instruments of criminal justice to go after your political upon listen again I\'m sorry but you\'re just not familiar with the details of the case the Deputy Director of the FBI himself Juan said there would have been no Russian collusion case without the dossier the dossier has been debunked none of that this is nonsense why eventually one yes Dan I have enjoyed this immensely but I want to thank you and John all for being here but I\'ve got to let you go get your turkey cook thank you I\'m kind of turned now to the ongoing battle between CNN and the White House CNN celebrated their legal victory when Jim Acosta got his press pass reinstated but what does it mean for everybody else Byron York writing yesterday said and I quote the Acosta decision could make it easier for White House officials to kick reporters out in quote joining me now to discuss is former White House press secretary and senior advisor to the America first action-packed Sean Spicer along with former Ronald Reagan aide and author of the forthcoming book swamp Wars Jeffrey Lord alright gentlemen let\'s talk about the new rules the White House is laid out for reporters actually will they be followed by Acosta and his colleagues in the press room or is the White House gonna need to come up with a maybe three strikes and you\'re out plan Sean your view on this this new announcement for the White House well governor it\'s great to see I think I talked about this my podcast with Kelly and Conway this is a discussion about content versus conduct and I think there\'s a very capable press secretary that\'s right now able to discern the difference between the two no one has a question about the content of any reporters question they can ask whatever they want but their conduct is it what\'s in question and I think that\'s what the judge ruled the other day will they behave in a way that\'s professional will they respect not just the office of the presidency but their fellow reporters and I think that\'s what this really comes down to I think there\'s a great press secretary now you may know her that knows how to call balls and strikes and there\'s a president that knows how to understand that as well and I think this is what it comes down to and where other organizations no names mentioned but you may guess them are trying to blur the lines is the question about what the content is no one cares what the reporter asks they can ask whatever question they want but the way that these reporters conduct themselves do they conduct themselves and show respect to not only their the fellow reporters but to the president United States and the White House is What\'s in question Jeffrey the judge ruled in a rather narrow way he did not say that the First Amendment was in any way being attacked by Jim Acosta losing his hard pass it was just that the process was not fully maybe visible to the world and therefore his Fifth Amendment issue was the only one but they celebrated as if somehow that they had taken a stand for democracy I don\'t remember any of the mainstream media being really that clever clear and honest about what that ruling was from the judge last week you\'re absolutely right governor and Shaun has hit the nail on the head this is about conduct not about content you know in the last couple days we\'ve heard from major Garrett now with CBS in the Obama days of course he was the White House correspondent for Fox no one remembers major Garrett acting like Jim Acosta it\'s because he didn\'t there was a way to do this shawn has been the the White House press secretary I\'ve been a press secretary to a senator and a congressman before that this is totally unprofessional stuff and I I think that CNN has to be very careful here of what they wish for because now if there are going to be a set of rules and regulations then then the the good press I carry that Sarah is she\'s gonna have to and she will I have no doubt call them out you know one other thing I took a quick look back at a memory from childhood of JFK\'s press conferences where he had adversarial reporters they were so well mannered governor it\'s beyond belief we have gone so far down the path in the wrong direction with this stuff well it\'s almost unbelievable and I think CNN and Jim Acosta will come to regret it so will their compadres in the broom I want to get your thoughts on the fact that the White House Correspondents Association of announced it it\'s not going to have a comedian roast the media next year what\'s known as the annual nerd prom and said they\'re gonna have biographer Ron chernow who\'s going to be the featured speaker to put some perspective on today\'s politics in history last year speaker annie trump comedian michelle wolf tweeted this in response she said and I quote the White House Correspondents Association are cowards the media is complicit and I couldn\'t be prouder in quote first of all I\'m not sure they had a comedian last year they had Michelle wolf and she just wasn\'t funny so Sean what\'s your response to the fact that Correspondents Association for the first time in decades has decided that they\'re not going to have that kind of lack I will say lack of political humor going on I you know what here\'s my response I applaud Olivia Knox in the White House Correspondents Association for doing this they want to have a dinner that celebrates the First Amendment and it actually shows that that\'s what their intent is so I applaud them for it because they last year they wanted to have a comedian and they talked about how this comedian michelle wolf would have would conduct herself and talk about the First Amendment and it wasn\'t it was rude it was disgusting and I think for them to at least acknowledge the fact that they want to talk about the First Amendment and have a historian do it I don\'t know what this individual is going to talk about but I think at least their intent is right and I\'ll give him credit for that because last year\'s dinner was disgusting and what I thought was more appalling about the dinner than anything is that they they branded it as about the First Amendment the comedian if that\'s what you call her wasn\'t that and no one in the White House Correspondents from NBC ABC CBS CNN said anything about the way that this person so-called conducted themselves in the quote spirit of the First Amendment so to see them at least acknowledge that that wasn\'t the right direction is is at least something that I want to applaud and say at least you got the message well we\'ll see how it works out Jeffrey Sean great to have you both happy Thanksgiving - thanks Happy Thanksgiving you bet straight ahead Trump\'s critics are lashing out over his response to Saudi Arabia today in the wake of the killing of journalist Jamal khashoggi up next our panel they\'ll explain why he might have sided with the lesser of two evils the fact is maybe he did maybe did we are with Saudi Arabia we\'re staying with Saudi Arabia and by the way just so everybody I have no business whatsoever with Saudi Arabia it\'s all about for me very simple it\'s America first Saudi Arabia if we broke with them I think your oil prices would go through the roof I\'ve kept them down it\'s a very simple equation for me I\'m about make America great again and I\'m about America first well that was the president earlier today addressing his decision not to further punish Saudi Arabia after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi come on what the White House and the critics are saying tonight let\'s go to Christian Fisher she\'s live from Washington Christin president Trump says that there will be no further repercussions against Saudi Arabia because he believes a good us-saudi relationship is simply more important he\'s putting business opportunities and security alliances over this human rights abuse the murder of journalist Jamal khashoggi now the decision comes despite a report that the CIA believes that the Saudi Crown Prince did order the killing but President Trump said today that he\'s standing by the Saudis and here\'s why I\'m not going to tell a country that\'s spending hundreds of billions of dollars and has helped me do one thing very importantly keep oil prices down so that they\'re not going to a hundred and 150 dollars a barrel I\'m not going to destroy the world economy and I\'m not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia but the president\'s decision is being denounced by members of both parties on Capitol Hill even by some of his closest allies Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said I fully realized we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage however when we lose our moral voice we lose her strongest asset and Senator Rand Paul said I\'m pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia first not America first now in that statement President Trump said to Congress that Congress was free to go in a different direction if it so choose and indeed tonight senator Graham said that he believes that there will be strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia Mike Thank You Kristen joining me now with reaction is Walid Phares the foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump\'s 2016 campaign David to Furi former Obama campaign foreign policy adviser and former State Department official as well as Rebecca Heinrich senior fellow at the Hudson Institute well lead let\'s talk about this good or bad move on the president\'s part I think the president is basically tell us that the national security the high interest of the United States basically tells us that we need to maintain the strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia but at the same time there needs to be an investigation and I think if you want to be fair in America and around the world that investigation should be comprehensive all the way if there are other crimes we\'ve heard that before so I think on the one hand maintaining the strategic relationship with the Saudis to contain the Iranians to make sure that we are continuing the fight against the jihadists and Isis is the right thing to do and the investigation should be separate from politics and go all the way Rebeca it it does seem though that this can\'t just be a binary choice is either the Saudis of the Iranians if somebody does something bad even if they\'re our friends don\'t we need to do something to say that this has got to be seriously dealt with and and the systematic murder of a journalist that\'s pretty serious Mike I think that the president actually is being prudent here it\'s not a binary choice as you said but we have sanctioned the 17 Saudis that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has identified as responsible for cash oh geez murder but the president has decided that we have to look at the context that this falls in and that\'s the security relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia there they\'re a couple of major things we got to keep in mind Saudi Arabia is critically important for the the global energy market even as the United States becomes energy independent our allies still rely on the petroleum that comes from Saudi Arabia and especially as we sanction Iran we need that oil to keep flowing from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia also helps us keep those energy choke points open and so that the Iranians don\'t have a monopoly on those including the Strait of Hormuz and then of course they\'re there helping the United States in in pushing back Iranian aggression generally in the region so that\'s a critical relationship and so I think that the president really thread the needle carefully in balancing human rights concerns of kocho Jews murder and also taking into consideration first and foremost the priority which is the security of Americans David the president Trump\'s not the first president that had a cozy relationship with the Saudis to my knowledge all of the presidents Democrats and Republicans have sometimes I think been too cozy with the Saudis even after 9/11 when we really didn\'t call their hand after the reality was that they were highly connected to the folks who were guilty of 9/11 so it\'s President Trump any different than the other presidents Democrat and Republican who have kind of looked the other way at the atrocities of the Saudis well that\'s a fair criticism against all of our presidents but this was a serious provocation the world is watching to see what America is going to do and what America needs to do is two things we have to send a message to the world that we won\'t tolerate this kind of behavior and there will be repercussions for it at the same time we have to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia because it is important Ally so if to punish them make them say they\'re sorry and make them do the things that show they\'re never going to do this again so other countries also don\'t do it but also preserve that that alliance that\'s important now President Trump was doing an okay job of that but it went off the rails today with his public statements he saw some of them in the previous reporting we also he also put out a written statement it looked like he wrote it himself it starts out saying that the world is a dangerous place that\'s not a way an appropriate way to start a foreign policy statement it sounds like he\'s saying he can\'t protect us from the types of thugs that Saudi Arabia sent to kill this journalist Khashoggi that\'s not appropriate American values are not for sale you heard Trump talking about how it\'s more important that we be able to sell arms to Saudi Arabia then that we stand up for rule of law that we stand up for human rights that\'s not right he needs to go back to the original attacked which is we\'re gonna punish Saudi Arabia but we\'re gonna preserve our relationship with the king but we\'re gonna encourage them to make sure everyone who\'s responsible no habit no matter how high it goes up everyone who is responsible is punished I need some quick answers from each of you let me start Waleed with you what are the president\'s options what should he do if you were whispering in his ear tonight what would you tell him he\'s got to do it\'s very simple on the one hand continue with these investigations we\'ve had investigations in the past like with the killing of the former prime minister of Lebanon Hariri that are 13 years for now so we have to be very serious about these investigations on the one hand the sanctions should target those who are responsible and not engage in geopolitical mistakes by engaging more influence of Iran in Yemen or in other parts of the region so we have to be very careful and distinguishing between the legal process and the geopolitical process Rebecca very quickly just a simple answer yeah does this hurt the president with members of his own party I don\'t think that it should I think the president\'s being completely realistic with the cards that he\'s been dealt he should continue to pressure the Saudis privately and we should continue to hope and to push the the print the young Prince to move towards reforms he\'s shown an interest in having a softening relationship with Israel that\'s a critical ally we need to continue to cultivate that relationship and pressure where we can so that it\'s useful and David does this send a a good or bad message to the Iranians well the Iranians like this right they want to see a division between Saudi Arabia in the US so we have to show we are gonna keep that alliance in place and we are going to continue to confront Iran but we\'re going to curb this kind of conduct by Saudi Arabia let\'s see what our CIA says about who is responsible the president should work with our intelligence agencies and with Congress to come up with a resolution that\'s going to punish Saudi Arabia but preserve the alliance thank you all David well lead Rebecca have a great Thanksgiving painting and coming up should a small handful of leftist judges be making decisions that adversely affect all of America now wait till you hear how an Obama appointed judge just up into the president\'s emergency restrictions on asylum claims that debate coming up next people should not be allowed to immediately run to this very friendly circuit and file their case it\'s a disgrace in my opinion it\'s a disgrace what happens with the Ninth Circuit well you go to the ninth circuit and it\'s a disgrace and I\'m going to put in a major complaint because you cannot win if you\'re us a case in the Ninth Circuit and I think it\'s a disgrace this was an Obama judge and I\'ll tell you what it\'s not going to happen like this anymore well that was President Trump taking aim at the liberal 9th Circuit and one judge in particular US District Judge John s.tiger who was nominated by President Obama back in 2012 judge tiger issued a nationwide injunction against Trump\'s newly announced emergency restrictions on asylum claims this means anyone seeking asylum can do it anywhere they want that\'s instead of the ports of entry that the Trump administration sought to restricted to the debate this topic is Francisco Hernandez immigration attorney and art Arthur from the Center for Immigration Studies all right let\'s start with you this is basically saying I\'ll come on in any way that you can I mean that seems a little dangerous to sort of change the rules of how people seeking asylum get into the country well it\'s the danger that Judge tiger actually ignores and in fact he seems to be completely unaware of the dangers that exist for people who enter the United States illegally 68% of all of those individuals who are assaulted during that trip one-third of all women are sexually assaulted during the trip through Mexico to the United States to enter illegally what the Trump administration has attempted to do is dissuade individuals from entering the United States illegally do you have an orderly process by which individuals go to ports of entry and yet for some reason judge Tiger has said that individuals who are entering the United States illegally have some right to enter the United States illegally or at least know that the Trump administration hasn\'t acted properly in constraining them from doing so it\'s absolutely incorrect it\'s not true it happens to be the law if he doesn\'t like it why didn\'t get Congress to do the immigration reform as promised for two years guys hold on hold on if it\'s the law then isn\'t that the law that you have to go through a port of entry isn\'t it the law that if you want to go into a country but that there are processes to legally immigrated and Francisca I believe that there ought to be a legal immigration policy I\'m for immigrant I\'m not against it I\'m even for them for people who are truly endangered but this is not what we\'re talking about we\'re talking about people just showing up so how do you respond to that well because they still have to make a claim past the threshold burden approved to show that there have at least the opportunity for political asylum and the people making the evaluation of whether they have shown that proof or employees of the State Department it doesn\'t mean to get political a sound because they cross in a legal port of entry or a non legal port of entry it doesn\'t matter the proof is the same in the people evaluating or employees of President Trump so it doesn\'t make a difference where they cross they still have to show up they don\'t they don\'t have a right they have a right to apply for asylum but they don\'t have eligibility for asylum and what the Trump administration attempted to do was restrict the ability of individuals who have entered the United States illegally in violation of US law and violate who have committed a crime from applying for asylum they don\'t have the they can\'t come through legally through a port of entry anyway it doesn\'t matter if they line up at the port of entry they\'re not going to be let in anyway until they\'re heard on their political asylum claim by the way Wow absolutely but if they show or the report of entry that we can allow them to enter in an orderly fashion we don\'t have them you know hiring smugglers we don\'t have them hiring the cartels to enter the United States legally yes there might be made really by God limiting the number people in Mexico Francisco Francisco let me ask you this if a person shows up you say it doesn\'t have to be a point of entry just anywhere and they say I need asylum so if that\'s the case yes where are they held until this investigation happens do we let them down freely in the country where where are they held without the criticism that they\'re being held illegally are unlawfully in order for them to make a claim of political asylum they have to go to an immigration official and stake their claims so even if they cross in a non port of entry they still have to go to an immigration official to set out their proof in if they go through a legal port of entry there is no mechanism where they can come in legally anyway that is the misconception that we\'re operating under they cannot wait with them go ahead there\'s no misconception there because they can make it allege they can assert credible fear if they go through a port of entry they\'re found to have a credible fear then they\'re placed in removal proceedings and they can make an application for asylum that\'s exactly what they do with the Trump order says but-but-but the law says it doesn\'t matter where even if they come in from a non illegal port of entry they still have to go to an immigration officer to make their claim for political asylum otherwise they they can never even apply it doesn\'t make a difference excuse me guys shouldn\'t it trouble us all that a judge a single federal judge decides for the entire nation that he\'s going to just up end the elected president\'s policies I think that\'s got to be a little bit we have to go I\'m so sorry we\'ll try to do it Thank You governor next time up next Laura recently spoke to a UC Berkeley student about how she was being targeted for her Christian beliefs this after she dared abstained from a vote on lb g TQ rights now this is a can\'t-miss defending the first segment which is coming up next I don\'t see a conflict between being able to accept love and validate you as an individual and yet not fully agreeing with how you choose identify yourself secondly simply daring to dissent our next guest has had her campus life destroyed isabella chow a student senator at the University of California Berkeley got kicked out of her own party and is being pressured to resign because of her religious views her crime she simply abstained from a largely symbolic student vote on October 31st because she didn\'t fully agree with certain clauses inside the pro lgbtq bills as a result she got labeled homophobic and transphobic even though she didn\'t even oppose the final vote Laura had the opportunity to speak with Isabella earlier let\'s watch take us through the past few weeks we first want to establish what happened this is a student government kind of proclamation stating what exactly yes so the bill the main bill that I abstained from oppose Trump\'s proposed reforms to title nine and specifically one clause where a person\'s gender is defined as a person\'s biological sex now the bill that I abstained from not only did it say you know we support freedom from discrimination and harassment for all individuals and especially LGBTQ individuals but at the end it there were clauses that asked me to promote an LGBTQ identity and lifestyle and to promote organizations the Meuse primary purpose is to promote the LGBTQ identity in lifestyle and I said because of my Christian views and because I represent the Christian community on campus I cannot fully support this bill okay so in for that being a Christian and being unapologetic you were labeled some pretty terrible things The Daily Californian said the following Isabella Chao made transphobic and homophobic statements during an ASUC meeting publicly dismissing the identities of individuals on campus Chow\'s language erased and humanized individuals etc etc how do you respond to that did you demonize people because of your faith yes I\'d actually like to go back to my original statements on the Senate floor on October 31st and what I said was one I think that discrimination and harassment is never ever okay but where I cross a line between you know where I can protect you as an individual and where I can promote your identity is a very fine line for me to walk right and so my response is I don\'t see a conflict between being able to accept love and validate you as an individual and yet not fully agreeing with how you choose identify yourself sexually it\'s a simple I think understanding here they\'re asking you to promote something that is contrary to your fundamental religious beliefs that is requiring you to worship at the altar of something that you don\'t believe in it\'s as simple as that whether it\'s a proclamation or or what you said on October 30th it\'s as simple as that and my problem with this is this is happening across the board in American society if you are a you try to be no one\'s perfect we all fall down but if you try to live your faith and you believe your your faith as I guess stated in the Bible or whatever you view the Bible to be and it\'s contrary to whatever prevailing norm is at at this point popular then you\'re labeled a hater homophobic transphobic any phobic here what comes to mind and they want to shut you down so that now you you are dehumanized so what they\'re accusing you of they are now doing to you requiring you to resign from you know your various positions have no position on campus and be reviled and for that we\'re supposed to give them like two thumbs up I don\'t understand how that\'s diversity today yeah I mean I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve been called the f-word person online social media on the Senate floor and I mean other slurs that I just don\'t want to repeat on camera oh and again when you say look I love all people but this just like you don\'t agree with everything I believe in I don\'t agree with everything you believe in but I love all people I love you

HILLARY CLINTON IS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR DIRTY RUSSIAN DOSSIER FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDF FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDS FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDA FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDF FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDA FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDD FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDA FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDU FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDE FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDC FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDM FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDI FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDT FILLED WITH RUSSIAN LIES, RAPIDD USING THOSE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR HILLARY RUSSIAN LIES, LITERALLY FRAUD COMMITTED AGAINST JUDGES TO GET SUBPOENAS TO GET WARRANTS AGAINST A TRUMP CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATE CARTER PAGE. THEN AFTER THAT, THE COORDINATED LEAK EFFORTS TO LITERALLY LIVE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PROPAGANDIZE THEM, MISINFORM THEM SO THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE 2016 ELECTION. THAT ALL NOW NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED IF WE REALLY CARE ABOUT RUSSIA COLLUSION. AND EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW, AND EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR LAW AND EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR LA, INTERNET, THE MUELLER PROBE, THAT SEEMS TO BE WINDING DOWN. IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" IS REPORTING THAT TRUMP WANTED TO ORDER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROSECUTE JAMES COMEY AND HILLARY CLINTON. NOW, DOES THAT SOUND LIKE BREAKING NEWS TO YOU? BECAUSE, IT ISN\'T, IT SHOULDN\'T, AND BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW THE PRESIDENT FEELS ABOUT HILLARY AND JAMES COMEY, AND WE KNOW HILLARY COMMITTED CRIMES. IT\'S NOT EVEN IN DISPUTE. OF COURSE THE ANTI-TRUMP HATERS ON FAKE NEWS CNN AND CONSPIRACY TB MSNBC, ACTING LIKE THEY FOUND IT. THEY\'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR TWO YEARS AND NOW THEY FOUND IT. MAYBE THEY COULD HAVE LISTENED TO HIS RALLIES THAT THEY WOULDN\'T PLAY WHEN THEY WERE CHANTING \"CNN SUCKS.\" &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES, THE PRESIDENT OR LEADER ORDERS THE PROSECUTION OF HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS EVIDENCE OF ABUSE OF POWER. TO SPEAK OF THIS IS ABSOLUTELY OFF THE CHARTS. DONALD TRUMP IS BASICALLY RUNNING HIS OFFICE LIKE HE OF THE HEAD OF A BANANA REPUBLIC BANANA REPUBLIC. &gt;&gt; I THINK THIS IS A SCANDAL 15 ON A 1-10 LEVEL. HE WAS ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO USE THE APPARATUS OF THE STATE TO PUNISH HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES. &gt;&gt; S NEVER DID ANYTHING! NEVER, EVER! IT\'S A PHONY STORY, FAKE NEWS. WHEN THE A STORY BROKE, WE REACHED OUT FOR REACTION AND HE SAID, HOW IS THIS EVEN OUR STORY? HE IS RIGHT AND HE WILL JOIN US LATER WITH MUCH MORE. DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, THEN-CANDIDATE TRUMP REPEATEDLY SAID HE WANTED HILLARY CLINTON PROSECUTED FOR HER EMAIL SERVERS SCANDAL, AND CLINTON AND COMEY BOTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED. WE ONLY INVESTIGATE TRUMP, I GUESS, IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMAT CLIMATE. HE GAVE HILLARY CLINTON THE NICKNAME \"CROOKED HILLARY\" FOR A REASON. SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED. THE SINGLE EASIEST SLAM-DUNK I\'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. WHEN YOU DELETE EMAILS, PLEAD THE FIFTH. BY THE WAY, COMEY\'S ACTIONS LEGALLY NEED TO HAVE BEEN LOOKED INTO AND IT SHOULD BE. WHEN WE COME BACK ALSO TONIGHT LATER ON IN THE PROGRAM, WE WILL HAVE SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM JOINING US. HE WILL WEIGH IN ON ALL OF US. AND NOW WE TURN TO THE SITUATION WITH SAUDI ARABIA\'S CROWN PRINC PRINCE. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION, THIS WILL BE VERY HARD FOR THE LIBERALS IN THE MEDIA TO PAY ATTENTION TO. I WANT THEM TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. THE MURDER OF THE SAUDI JOURNALIST, JAMAL KHASHOGGI, WAS REPREHENSIBLE. THAT IS EVIL. I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THIS EVIL ACT WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE SAUDI CONSULATE AT THE DIRECTION OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S CROWN PRINCE KNOWN AS M.B.S. THERE IS NOBODY WHO HAS BEEN TOUGHER ON SAUDI ARABIA AND NOBODY MORE CONSISTENT ON MY CRITICISMS OF SAUDI ARABIA FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASON. I HAVE BEEN THEIR LOUDEST CRITIC FOR GOOD REASON. I HAVE CALLED OUT SAUDI ARABIA\'S RAMPANT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, THEIR COMPLETE LACK OF COMMON DECENCY, SAUDI ARABIA\'S TREATMENT OF WOMEN, THEY CAN\'T DRIVE, UP UNTIL RECENTLY, COULDN\'T VOTE, AND LITERALLY HAVE TO ASK THEIR HUSBANDS IF THEY MAY TRAVEL ABROAD, GAY PEOPLE ARE KILLED JUST FOR BEING WHO THEY ARE, CHRISTIANS AND JEWS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BUILD A TEMPLE OR CHURCH. AND UNTIL RECENTLY, WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA COULDN\'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT BEING AROUND THE MALE GUARDIAN FROM THEIR FAMILY OR ELSE THEY WOULD GET IN TROUBLE. BY THE WAY, WE MAY NEED PERMISSION FOR JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, EVEN TO MARRY, TO WORK. BEING GAY IS ILLEGAL, PUNISHABLE BY DEATH. CHRISTIAN AND JEWISH TEMPLES BAND. THEY ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ACCEPT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THINK ABOUT THIS, THE CLINTONS TOOK TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ENRICH THEMSELVES AND THEIR FOUNDATION FROM THE SAUDI KINGDOM. WHAT DID THEY GET? THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN AS CRITICAL AS WE HAVE BEEN. I WILL CALL OUT EVIL WHEREVER I SEE IT. THE MURDER OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS EVIL. THE WORLD IS AN UGLY, DANGEROUS, COMPLICATED PLACE. TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP ISSUED THIS STATEMENT REAFFIRMING AMERICA\'S STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND HAD THIS TO SAY WITH REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THEY TOOK SUCH UMBRAGE WITH. TAKE A LOOK. &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT IRAN, TAKE A LOOK AT IRAN, AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THEY ARE A TERRORIST NATION RIGHT NOW. ALTHOUGH, I MUST TELL YOU, THEY ARE A LOT BETTER RIGHT NOW THAN THEY WERE WHEN I TOOK OFFICE. WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, THEY WERE HEADING IN A VERY, VERY BAD DIRECTION. AT SOME POINT, THINGS VERY POSITIVE FRANKLY COULD HAPPEN WITH IRAN, BUT WE ALSO NEED A COUNTERBALANCE. AND ISRAEL NEEDS HELP ALSO. IF WE ABANDON SAUDI ARABIA, IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; S E PRESIDENT IS RIGHT AND I WANT TO EXPLAIN IN ALL SPECIFICITY WHY THIS ISN\'T ABOUT POLITICS. AS EVIL AS THIS KINGDOM IS AS I HAVE SAID OVER THE YEARS, THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT. SAUDI ARABIA HAS NOW EMERGED AT AN IMPORTANT POINT IN HISTORY AS A PARTNER IN THE MIDDLE EAST. LET ME EXPLAIN THIS, AND IT BRINGS US TO A QUICK \"HANNITY\" HISTORY LESSON. AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO MAKE A LOT OF TOUGH, VERY, VERY DIFFICULT STRATEGIC DECISIONS, NOT LIKE PUTTING MILLIONS IN YOUR POCKET LIKE OH, THE CLINTONS. AND DEAL WITH A LOT OF IMMORAL AND IN SOME CASES EVIL INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS. I WILL GIVE YOU ONE QUICK EXAMPLE, WORLD WAR II. WE STRUCK ALLIANCES WITH STALIN, A MASS MURDERER IN RUSSIA, THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. THAT EVIL DICTATOR WOULD GO ON TO MURDER MORE PEOPLE THAN ADOLF HITLER, BUT THE SURVIVOR OF AMERICA AND EUROPE WAS IN JEOPARDY, AND DURING THE COLD WAR, WE PARTNERED WITH DOZENS OF BRUTAL DICTATORS TO VIOLENTLY SQUASH THE SPREAD OF THE EVILS OF COMMUNISM. NOW SAUDI ARABIA IS SIMILARLY, HORRIBLE REGIME, BUT THERE IS A KEY ALLIANCE THAT IS NOW IN PLACE, AND THAT WOULD BE THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL, AND EGYPT, AND JORDAN, AND ALSO, LET\'S SEE, THE SAUDIS, AND THE EMIRATES. AND WHAT IS THE ALLIANCE AGAINS AGAINST? IRAN. THEY ARE CURRENTLY THE NUMBER ONE STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR. THEY ARE FUNDING NUMEROUS PROXY WARS. AND IF THEY WANT TO WIPE ISRAEL OFF THE MAP, IF THEY EVER GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN DIE. WE HAVE TO MAKE A STRATEGIC DECISION. WE CAN\'T TAKE THAT RISK. IN FACT, THE CURRENT ALLIANCE -- AGAIN, THE U.S., ISRAEL, JORDAN, THE SAUDIS -- THEY HAVE BEEN A CRUCIAL FORCE IN CHECKING THIS IRANIAN HEDGE ENEMY. THIS IS THE ALLIANCE WE NOW NEED TO STOP THESE RADICAL THREATS FROM EVER GETTING THEIR HANDS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS. STILL MANY ON THE LEFT ARE IN MELTDOWN MODE OVER THE PRESIDENT\'S HANDLING OF SAUDI ARABIA. YOU KNOW WHAT? WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN? FORMER OBAMA U.S. INVESTOR, SAMANTHA POWER TWEETING, \"IT IS A MEAN AND NASTY WORLD BUT TRUMP SIDING WITH THE MEANEST AND NASTIEST OUT THERE, WHETHER VLADIMIR PUTIN, OR ASSASSIN M.B.S. WILL LEAVE THE WORLD EVEN NASTIER.\" THIS STATEMENT IS A GREEN LIGHT FOR WOULD-BE MURDERERS IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THINGS TRUMP THINGS WE NEED TO.\" HOW ABOUT A HISTORY LESSON FOR YOU, MAYBE YOU FORGOT ABOUT YOUR TIME AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE IT WAS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA WHO SENT TANKS, F-16 FIGHTER JETS, OVER $1 BILLION TO A GUY BY THE NAME OF MOHAMMED MORSI, HE WAS WITH THE RADICAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD THAT ROSE TO POWER IN EGYPT. MOHAMMED MORSI, THE GUY WHO ONCE REFERRED TO PEOPLE IN ISRAEL AND JEWS AS THE DESCENDANTS OF APES AND PIGS IN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD FUNDING TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD. BY THE WAY, THAT IS YOUR FORMER BOSS, OBAMA, WHO PARTNERED WITH THEM FOR NO STRATEGIC REASON. OBAMA GIFTED THAT GUY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, MATERIAL SUPPORT, PLANES, TANKS, AND COLD HARD CASH. WE CAN\'T FORGET THAT YEAH, OBAMA ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE RADICAL STATE SPONSORS OF TERROR AND A HORRIBLY FLAWED NUCLEAR DEAL, THE U.S. AND $1.7 BILLION IN CASH AND OTHER CURRENCY DIRECTLY TO THEM. THE SAME PEOPLE WHO PLOTTED THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES ON A DAILY BASIS, AND THANK GOD IS INSTRUCTING THEM TO DO IT, AND TREAT WOMEN AND CHRISTIANS AND JEWS AND EVERYONE ELSE. SO PLEASE, SPARE US THE FAINT MORAL OUTRAGE. REMEMBER, AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER, HILLARY CLINTON TOTALLY IGNORE THE SAUDI ARABIA TREATMENT OF WOMEN AND CHRISTIANS BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT HER SILENCE. SHE IS NEVER CRITICIZED THE WAY WE HAVE REGULARLY ON THIS PROGRAM. TODAY, WITH IRAN NOW POSING THE SINGLE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THE WORLD, THIS STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA IS TOO IMPORTANT, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, TO DISMANTLE. WE CAN KEEP IT TOGETHER. IT\'S SMART. IT\'S INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED, INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND ON TOP OF THAT, THOUGH SAUDIS ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WEAPONS PURCHASES THAT, BY THE WAY, BOTH RUSSIA AND CHINA WANTED, AND WE GOT. THAT MEANS, WHAT? WE ARE GOING TO MAKE, LET\'S SEE, VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THE LEADERS OF CHINA RICH AGAIN? I DON\'T THINK THAT\'S A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE AMERICAN JOBS AWAY FROM THEM. I AM NOT WILLING TO DO THAT. DO WE WANT TO HELP OUT, PUT A NEW ALLIANCE TOGETHER? LET\'S SEE, THE IRANIANS, SYRIANS, CHINA, VLADIMIR PUTIN AND RUSSIA? IT\'S A DARK, EVIL, UGLY WORLD AT TIMES. FOR MORE COMPLICATED THAN WHAT LIBERAL NETWORKS THAT HATE DONALD TRUMP EVEN, YOU KNOW, TAKING A BREATH COULD EVER POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE TO TURN TO ANOTHER SITUATION CLOSER TO HOME. FOR WEEKS, WE\'VE BEEN SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THE MASSIVE CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS MARCHING TOWARDS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WE HAVE TRACKED THEM THROUGH CENTRAL AMERICA AS THEY BROKE DOWN GUATEMALA\'S BORDER FENCE, STORMED INTO SOUTHERN MEXICO. WE HAVE FOLLOWED THIS JOURNEY NORTH TOWARDS THE U.S. BORDER AND WARNED ABOUT POSSIBLE GAMING AND CRIMINAL INFILTRATION. WE SHOWED YOU HOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PREPARED FOR THE APPROACHING CARAVAN. THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE-DUTY TROOPS WERE SENT TO THE BORDER, RAZOR WIRE WAS DEPLOYED TO BOLSTER THE FENCING, AND NEW BARRIERS WERE ALSO CONSTRUCTED. HARDWORKING U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS STEPPED THEIR EFFORTS UP. A SERIOUS SITUATION, BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE DEMOCRATS. REMEMBER FOR A WHILE THEY WERE IGNORING THE MIGRANT CARAVAN AND ACCUSING REPUBLICANS OF FABRICATING THIS PHONY CRISIS IN THE LEAD UP TO AN ELECTION FOR POLITICAL GAIN? OTHERS CALLED ALL A CONSPIRACY THEORY. OBAMA LAUGHED AT THE IDEA. AT ONE EVENT HE WAS SPEAKING AT. NO, IT\'S A REAL SITUATION WITH REAL CONSEQUENCES. WE NOW KNOW OUR OWN DHS AND LEADERS IN MEXICO SAYING THAT OVER 500 CRIMINALS ARE NOW TRAVELING WITH THE MIGRANT, AND ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS EVEN PAID UNDERCOVER INFORMANTS TO ADDRESS SECURITY THREATS. BY THE WAY, THAT IS CALLED BEING SMART. YESTERDAY WE SAW IN TIJUANA, AUTHORITIES HAVING TO ARREST 34 MEMBERS OF THAT CARAVAN FOR OFFENSES LIKE PUBLIC INTOXICATION, DISTURBING THE PEACE, RESISTING ARREST. DESPITE ALL OF THIS, THE FEDERAL JUDGE YESTERDAY IN SAN FRANCISCO, WHAT A SHOCK, DEALT A BLOW TO THE PRESIDENT\'S BORDER SECURITY EFFORTS IN THE RULE OF LAW, STRIKING DOWN A TEMPORARY ASYLUM BAN ON THOSE WHO DON\'T APPLY AT A PORT OF ENTRY. SEE WHY HOLDING THE U.S. SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT NOW CAMPAIGNING AND PICKING UP SEATS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 100 YEARS, A SITTING PRESIDENT THAT GETS THE WHITE HOUSE, IS ABLE TO DO THIS IN HIS FIRST MIDTERM ELECTION. AS I\'VE BEEN TELLING YOU, THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE JUST SEARCHING FOR A BETTER LIFE. I GET THAT, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO BET ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO COME HERE. 500 CRIMINALS INFILTRATED, WALKING WITH THE CARAVAN PEOPLE. IT EVEN WHITE MEXICAN PEOPLE NOW ARE PROTESTING THE CARAVAN AND SAYING THAT THEY HAVE EVEN BEEN INVADED. ECHOING PRESIDENT TRUMP\'S TOUGH TALK ON THE BOARD APPEARED TO TAKE LOOK. &gt;&gt; [SPEAKING SPANISH] &gt;&gt; S INVASION. THERE ARE NOW THOUSANDS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. PEOPLE ON THE LEFT SAID THEY WOULD NEVER GET THERE. OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST A SECURITY UNINVITED, UNCHECKED, MASS MIGRATION COMES AT A MASSIVE COST, YOU, WE THE PEOPLE, THE TAXPAYERS. ANY REPORT EXPOSING HOW YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, PAY FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO THE JUNE OF $18.5 BILLION A YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES, ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS ARE UP. COMES WITH IT, A MASSIVE PRICE TAG FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE ON THIS DEVELOPING SITUATION ALSO THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. TONIGHT, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS ALL BUT REFUSING TO COVER THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER, BUT INSTEAD, THEY ARE BUSY OBSESSING OVER A VULGAR TERM. SHE BRIEFLY USED A PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT, THIS GOES BACK 15 MONTHS AGO TO SEND AND RECEIVE SOME THAT WERE WORK-RELATED MESSAGES. TALKING ABOUT A FEW HUNDRED EMAILS, 15 MONTHS AGO, SHE WAS NEW ON THE JOB, NEW TO WASHINGTON, ALL OF THE EMAILS HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS LIKE HILLARY, ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER CRITICIZED HER. NOTHING HAS BEEN DELETED, A NONSTORY. NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. BUT HILLARY CLINTON, WHEN SHE WAS CONDUCTING STATE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS WITH AN EMAIL, A BATHROOM MOM-AND-POP COMPANY, MANY OF THOSE EMAILS SHE SENT AND RECEIVED WORD TOP SECRET. SHE LIED TO US. WE CAN PROVE THE LIE. THOUSANDS OF EMAILS WERE DELETE DELETED. GUESS WHAT, NONE OF THESE WERE TURNED OVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND THERE WERE MEDIA REMAINED SILENT. THEY COVERED FOR THEIR FRIENDS, THE CLINTONS. NOW ARE THEY TREATING THE IVANKA, YOU KNOW, THE NONSTORY LIKE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THE CENTURY. WHAT A BUNCH OF PHONY HYPOCRITES. TO SPEAK OF THE ARROGANCE, THE INCREDIBLE ARROGANCE WITH A LITTLE MEASURE OF STUPIDITY. &gt;&gt; IT\'S POSSIBLE SHE IS CONSIDERED A PRINCESS AND TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE RULES THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND THE PRESIDENT, CABINET, AND ADVISORS GO BY. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE NEW CONGRESS GETS SWORN IN, THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, THEY NEED TO SEEK NOTHING LESS OF IVANKA TRUMP AND HER LAWYER THAN THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; THEY REALLY ARE A MOB FAMILY. THEY BASICALLY TOOK WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THE BUSINESS, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, AND BROUGHT IT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY DIDN\'T CARE AT ALL WHAT THE RULES WERE AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO. &gt;&gt; S EY DIDN\'T COVER HILLARY CLINTON\'S CRIMES. WE KNOW SHE COMMITTED CRIMES. THIS IS HYPOCRISY IN ACTION. THIS IS WHY SO MANY AMERICANS DON\'T TRUST THE PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA -- NOR SHOULD DO. IT DESTROYED TRUMP EVERY SECOND, EVERY MINUTE, EVERY HOUR, EVERY DAY. THEY ARE JUST HYPOCRITES. TWO WEEKS AGO, THE MEDIA IGNORING THE STORY, JAMES COMEY WAS USING PRIVATE EMAIL FOR FBI BUSINESS. BASICALLY CRICKETS. YOU DIDN\'T HEAR THE SAME TYPE OF CRITICISM. IT\'S THE SAME REASON NOW MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA NOW TOTALLY IGNORING THEIR FORMER BFF, MICHAEL AVENATTI APPEARED FOR SO MANY MONTHS HE WAS THE POSTER CHILD ON FAKE NEWS CNN, CONSPIRACY TB MSNBC, SPREADING FILE CLAIMS AGAINST JUST A KAVANAUGH THAT THEY WERE SPREADING AND BELIEVING. THEY BELIEVED. GUESS WHAT? THE LEFT, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY CHANGED THEIR GUILT BY ACCUSATION MOTTO. THE NEW STANDARD THEY CREATED IN AMERICA. YET NO ONE IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, ALL OF AVENATTI\'S FRIENDS, THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH SILENT AND PRETTY MUCH NOT SAYING ANYTHING. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT IS SO SERIOUS, THAT IS NOT WHAT MATTERS TO THEM, BECAUSE IF IT DID, THEY WOULDN\'T BE BEST FRIENDS WITH THE CLINTON\'S, WOULD THEY? THEY WOULD NOT HAVE WORSHIPED THE MEDIA OR BEEN WORSHIPED BY THE MEDIA AS THEY HAVE BEEN. AND KEITH ELLISON WOULD HAVE BEEN VETTED AND CALLED OUT. THE ISSUE REALLY SEEMS TO BE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR CHARGES LIKE THIS IMPORTANT ONLY IF THEY CAN BLUDGEON A REPUBLICAN. THEN THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS, THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. WHERE IS ALL THE OUTRAGE ON THESE CHANNELS, THEIR BEST FRIENDS? IF YOU ARE ON THE LEFT, THE RULES DON\'T APPLY TO YOU. ONE SET OF GESTURES FOR THEM, AND THE GUILLOTINE PRETTY MUCH FOR EVERYONE ELSE. THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA\'S POSTELECTION SPIN DOESN\'T HELP EITHER. THE DELUSIONAL MEDIA ARE NOW TRYING TO PULL A FAST BALL ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAYING TRUMP HAS BEEN REJECTED, THIS HAS BEEN A MASSIVE BLUE WAVE. HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN CONTAINED BY SOME IMAGINARY BLUE WAVE. IN HISTORICAL TERMS, IT WAS A TRICKLE. SOME DEMOCRATS REFUSING TO EVEN CALL THE ELECTION LEGITIMATE IN RACES THAT DIDN\'T GO THEIR WAY. WE SAW THAT IN GEORGIA IN THE GOVERNOR\'S RACE. BRIAN CAMP WON OUTRIGHT, BUT STACY ABRAMS SAID IN GEORGIA DID NOT HAVE A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION AND BRIAN CAMP DISMANTLED THE DEMOCRACY. REALLY CLASSY. IT SOUNDS LIKE A SORE LOSERRISM. ACCORDING TO FOX\'S ACCOUNT, THE DEMOCRATS WON 232 SEATS IN THE HOUSE COMPARED TO 199 FOR THE REPUBLICANS. MORE RACES YET TO BE CALLED. THEY PICKED UP 37 SEATS FOR THE DEMOCRATS, BUT THEY LOST ALL THOSE SEATS AND CLAIRE McCASKILL IS OUT, AND NELSON IS OUT, AND DONNELLY IS OUT. OH, YEAH. SO, PRESIDENT TRUMP, IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT NUMBERS AND HISTORY DID CONSIDERABLY IT MASSIVELY BETTER THE PREVIOUS TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS. 2010, OBAMA\'S FIRST MIDTERM. DEMOCRATIC LOST 63 SEATS IN THE HOUSE, \'94, BILL CLINTON LOST 52 SEATS IN THE HOUSE AND ATE IN THE SENATE. BEAR IN MIND, THE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY ADDED TO THEIR SENATE MAJORITY AND BY THE WAY, THAT NUMBER IS LIKELY TO GROW NEXT WEEK. AN IMPORTANT ELECTION. IF YOU ARE IN MISSISSIPPI, THAT SPECIAL ELECTION, NOVEMBER 27TH. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE STUMPING FOR HYDE SMITH IN HER BID TO BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT VOTE IF YOU LIVE THERE. THIS IS A BIG RACE. REPUBLICAN VICTORY MEANS 53-47', 'President Trump has submitted written answers to Special Counsel Mueller\'s questions.', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'president-trump-has-submitted-written-answers-to-special-counsel-muellers-questions', '', '', '2018-11-21 06:44:21', '2018-11-21 06:44:21', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=22', 0, 'post', '', 0),

RUDY GIULIANI ADDING THAT IT HAS BEEN OPPOSITION FROM THE OUTSET THAT MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN RAISED CALLS FOR SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AND IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF A LEGITIMATE INQUIRY. THE PRESIDENT HAS NONETHELESS PROVIDED UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH MORE THAN 30 WITNESSES, 1.4 MILLION PAGES OF MATERIAL AND NOW THE PRESIDENT\'S WRITTEN RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS. IT IS TIME TO BRING THIS INQUIRY TO A CONCLUSION.\" MAKE NO MISTAKE, HUGE WIN TONIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS LEGAL TEAM. HIS ATTORNEYS WERE PUSHING FOR WRITTEN ANSWERS. THAT MEANS NO SUBPOENA FIGHT, NO SUBPOENA BEFORE THE GRAND JURY, NO IN-PERSON INTERVIEW, NO YEAR-LONG FLIGHT HEADED TOWARDS THE SUPREME COURT, NO PERJURY TRAPS, AND KEEP IN MIND, THESE WERE ALL QUESTIONS, NONE OF THEM WERE ABOUT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. WHY? BECAUSE THERE NEVER WAS ANY, JUST LIKE THERE WAS NEVER A COLLISION. INSTEAD, MUELLER FOCUSED ON THIS RUSSIA COLLUSION AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY ANSWERED THESE QUESTIONS, DENIED ANY COLLISION, ANY CONSPIRACY, ANY COORDINATION WITH ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY RUSSIA. NOW THIS HAS JUST BECOME A FORMALITY. AFTER SPENDING NEARLY 600 DAYS, THE INVESTIGATION MIGHT SOON FINALLY BE COMING TO AN END.

WILL LEAVE THE WORLD EVEN NASTIER.\" THIS STATEMENT IS A GREEN LIGHT FOR WOULD-BE MURDERERS IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THINGS TRUMP THINGS WE NEED TO.\" HOW ABOUT A HISTORY LESSON FOR YOU, MAYBE YOU FORGOT ABOUT YOUR TIME AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE IT WAS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA WHO SENT TANKS, F-16 FIGHTER JETS, OVER $1 BILLION TO A GUY BY THE NAME OF MOHAMMED MORSI, HE WAS WITH THE RADICAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD THAT ROSE TO POWER IN EGYPT. MOHAMMED MORSI, THE GUY WHO ONCE REFERRED TO PEOPLE IN ISRAEL AND JEWS AS THE DESCENDANTS OF APES AND PIGS IN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD FUNDING TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD. BY THE WAY, THAT IS YOUR FORMER BOSS, OBAMA, WHO PARTNERED WITH THEM FOR NO STRATEGIC REASON. OBAMA GIFTED THAT GUY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, MATERIAL SUPPORT, PLANES, TANKS, AND COLD HARD CASH. WE CAN\'T FORGET THAT YEAH, OBAMA ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE RADICAL STATE SPONSORS OF TERROR AND A HORRIBLY FLAWED NUCLEAR DEAL, THE U.S. AND $1.7 BILLION IN CASH AND OTHER CURRENCY DIRECTLY TO THEM. THE SAME PEOPLE WHO PLOTTED THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES ON A DAILY BASIS, AND THANK GOD IS INSTRUCTING THEM TO DO IT, AND TREAT WOMEN AND CHRISTIANS AND JEWS AND EVERYONE ELSE. SO PLEASE, SPARE US THE FAINT MORAL OUTRAGE. REMEMBER, AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER, HILLARY CLINTON TOTALLY IGNORE THE SAUDI ARABIA TREATMENT OF WOMEN AND CHRISTIANS BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT HER SILENCE. SHE IS NEVER CRITICIZED THE WAY WE HAVE REGULARLY ON THIS PROGRAM. TODAY, WITH IRAN NOW POSING THE SINGLE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THE WORLD, THIS STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA IS TOO IMPORTANT, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, TO DISMANTLE. WE CAN KEEP IT TOGETHER. IT\'S SMART. IT\'S INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED, INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND ON TOP OF THAT, THOUGH SAUDIS ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WEAPONS PURCHASES THAT, BY THE WAY, BOTH RUSSIA AND CHINA WANTED, AND WE GOT. THAT MEANS, WHAT? WE ARE GOING TO MAKE, LET\'S SEE, VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THE LEADERS OF CHINA RICH AGAIN? I DON\'T THINK THAT\'S A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE AMERICAN JOBS AWAY FROM THEM. I AM NOT WILLING TO DO THAT. DO WE WANT TO HELP OUT, PUT A NEW ALLIANCE TOGETHER? LET\'S SEE, THE IRANIANS, SYRIANS, CHINA, VLADIMIR PUTIN AND RUSSIA? IT\'S A DARK, EVIL, UGLY WORLD AT TIMES. FOR MORE COMPLICATED THAN WHAT LIBERAL NETWORKS THAT HATE DONALD TRUMP EVEN, YOU KNOW, TAKING A BREATH COULD EVER POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE TO TURN TO ANOTHER SITUATION CLOSER TO HOME. FOR WEEKS, WE\'VE BEEN SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THE MASSIVE CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS MARCHING TOWARDS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WE HAVE TRACKED THEM THROUGH CENTRAL AMERICA AS THEY BROKE DOWN GUATEMALA\'S BORDER FENCE, STORMED INTO SOUTHERN MEXICO. WE HAVE FOLLOWED THIS JOURNEY NORTH TOWARDS THE U.S. BORDER AND WARNED ABOUT POSSIBLE GAMING AND CRIMINAL INFILTRATION. WE SHOWED YOU HOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PREPARED FOR THE APPROACHING CARAVAN. THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE-DUTY TROOPS WERE SENT TO THE BORDER, RAZOR WIRE WAS DEPLOYED TO BOLSTER THE FENCING, AND NEW BARRIERS WERE ALSO CONSTRUCTED. HARDWORKING U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS STEPPED THEIR EFFORTS UP. A SERIOUS SITUATION, BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE DEMOCRATS. REMEMBER FOR A WHILE THEY WERE IGNORING THE MIGRANT CARAVAN AND ACCUSING REPUBLICANS OF FABRICATING THIS PHONY CRISIS IN THE LEAD UP TO AN ELECTION FOR POLITICAL GAIN? OTHERS CALLED ALL A CONSPIRACY THEORY. OBAMA LAUGHED AT THE IDEA. AT ONE EVENT HE WAS SPEAKING AT. NO, IT\'S A REAL SITUATION WITH REAL CONSEQUENCES. WE NOW KNOW OUR OWN DHS AND LEADERS IN MEXICO SAYING THAT OVER 500 CRIMINALS ARE NOW TRAVELING WITH THE MIGRANT, AND ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS EVEN PAID UNDERCOVER INFORMANTS TO ADDRESS SECURITY THREATS. BY THE WAY, THAT IS CALLED BEING SMART. YESTERDAY WE SAW IN TIJUANA, AUTHORITIES HAVING TO ARREST 34 MEMBERS OF THAT CARAVAN FOR OFFENSES LIKE PUBLIC INTOXICATION, DISTURBING THE PEACE, RESISTING ARREST. DESPITE ALL OF THIS, THE FEDERAL JUDGE YESTERDAY IN SAN FRANCISCO, WHAT A SHOCK, DEALT A BLOW TO THE PRESIDENT\'S BORDER SECURITY EFFORTS IN THE RULE OF LAW, STRIKING DOWN A TEMPORARY ASYLUM BAN ON THOSE WHO DON\'T APPLY AT A PORT OF ENTRY. SEE WHY HOLDING THE U.S. SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT NOW CAMPAIGNING AND PICKING UP SEATS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 100 YEARS, A SITTING PRESIDENT THAT GETS THE WHITE HOUSE, IS ABLE TO DO THIS IN HIS FIRST MIDTERM ELECTION. AS I\'VE BEEN TELLING YOU, THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE JUST SEARCHING FOR A BETTER LIFE. I GET THAT, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO BET ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO COME HERE. 500 CRIMINALS INFILTRATED, WALKING WITH THE CARAVAN PEOPLE. IT EVEN WHITE MEXICAN PEOPLE NOW ARE PROTESTING THE CARAVAN AND SAYING THAT THEY HAVE EVEN BEEN INVADED. ECHOING PRESIDENT TRUMP\'S TOUGH TALK ON THE BOARD APPEARED TO TAKE LOOK. &gt;&gt; [SPEAKING SPANISH] &gt;&gt; S INVASION. THERE ARE NOW THOUSANDS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. PEOPLE ON THE LEFT SAID THEY WOULD NEVER GET THERE. OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST A SECURITY UNINVITED, UNCHECKED, MASS MIGRATION COMES AT A MASSIVE COST, YOU, WE THE PEOPLE, THE TAXPAYERS. ANY REPORT EXPOSING HOW YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, PAY FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO THE JUNE OF $18.5 BILLION A YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES, ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS ARE UP. COMES WITH IT, A MASSIVE PRICE TAG FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE ON THIS DEVELOPING SITUATION ALSO THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. TONIGHT, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS ALL BUT REFUSING TO COVER THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER, BUT INSTEAD, THEY ARE BUSY OBSESSING OVER A VULGAR TERM. SHE BRIEFLY USED A PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT, THIS GOES BACK 15 MONTHS AGO TO SEND AND RECEIVE SOME THAT WERE WORK-RELATED MESSAGES. TALKING ABOUT A FEW HUNDRED EMAILS, 15 MONTHS AGO, SHE WAS NEW ON THE JOB, NEW TO WASHINGTON, ALL OF THE EMAILS HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS LIKE HILLARY, ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER CRITICIZED HER. NOTHING HAS BEEN DELETED, A NONSTORY. NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. BUT HILLARY CLINTON, WHEN SHE WAS CONDUCTING STATE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS WITH AN EMAIL, A BATHROOM MOM-AND-POP COMPANY, MANY OF THOSE EMAILS SHE SENT AND RECEIVED WORD TOP SECRET. SHE LIED TO US. WE CAN PROVE THE LIE. THOUSANDS OF EMAILS WERE DELETE DELETED. GUESS WHAT, NONE OF THESE WERE TURNED OVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND THERE WERE MEDIA REMAINED SILENT. THEY COVERED FOR THEIR FRIENDS, THE CLINTONS. NOW ARE THEY TREATING THE IVANKA, YOU KNOW, THE NONSTORY LIKE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THE CENTURY. WHAT A BUNCH OF PHONY HYPOCRITES. TO SPEAK OF THE ARROGANCE, THE INCREDIBLE ARROGANCE WITH A LITTLE MEASURE OF STUPIDITY. &gt;&gt; IT\'S POSSIBLE SHE IS CONSIDERED A PRINCESS AND TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE RULES THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND THE PRESIDENT, CABINET, AND ADVISORS GO BY. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE NEW CONGRESS GETS SWORN IN, THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, THEY NEED TO SEEK NOTHING LESS OF IVANKA TRUMP AND HER LAWYER THAN THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; THEY REALLY ARE A MOB FAMILY. THEY BASICALLY TOOK WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THE BUSINESS, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, AND BROUGHT IT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY DIDN\'T CARE AT ALL WHAT THE RULES WERE AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO. &gt;&gt; S EY DIDN\'T COVER HILLARY CLINTON\'S CRIMES. WE KNOW SHE COMMITTED CRIMES. THIS IS HYPOCRISY IN ACTION. THIS IS WHY SO MANY AMERICANS DON\'T TRUST THE PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA -- NOR SHOULD DO. IT DESTROYED TRUMP EVERY SECOND, EVERY MINUTE, EVERY HOUR, EVERY DAY. THEY ARE JUST HYPOCRITES. TWO WEEKS AGO, THE MEDIA IGNORING THE STORY, JAMES COMEY WAS USING PRIVATE EMAIL FOR FBI BUSINESS. BASICALLY CRICKETS. YOU DIDN\'T HEAR THE SAME TYPE OF CRITICISM. IT\'S THE SAME REASON NOW MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA NOW TOTALLY IGNORING THEIR FORMER BFF, MICHAEL AVENATTI APPEARED FOR SO MANY MONTHS HE WAS THE POSTER CHILD ON FAKE NEWS CNN, CONSPIRACY TB MSNBC, SPREADING FILE CLAIMS AGAINST JUST A KAVANAUGH THAT THEY WERE SPREADING AND BELIEVING. THEY BELIEVED. GUESS WHAT? THE LEFT, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY CHANGED THEIR GUILT BY ACCUSATION MOTTO. THE NEW STANDARD THEY CREATED IN AMERICA. YET NO ONE IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, ALL OF AVENATTI\'S FRIENDS, THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH SILENT AND PRETTY MUCH NOT SAYING ANYTHING. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT IS SO SERIOUS, THAT IS NOT WHAT MATTERS TO THEM, BECAUSE IF IT DID, THEY WOULDN\'T BE BEST FRIENDS WITH THE CLINTON\'S, WOULD THEY? THEY WOULD NOT HAVE WORSHIPED THE MEDIA OR BEEN WORSHIPED BY THE MEDIA AS THEY HAVE BEEN. AND KEITH ELLISON WOULD HAVE BEEN VETTED AND CALLED OUT. THE ISSUE REALLY SEEMS TO BE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR CHARGES LIKE THIS IMPORTANT ONLY IF THEY CAN BLUDGEON A REPUBLICAN. THEN THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS, THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. WHERE IS ALL THE OUTRAGE ON THESE CHANNELS, THEIR BEST FRIENDS? IF YOU ARE ON THE LEFT, THE RULES DON\'T APPLY TO YOU. ONE SET OF GESTURES FOR THEM, AND THE GUILLOTINE PRETTY MUCH FOR EVERYONE ELSE. THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA\'S POSTELECTION SPIN DOESN\'T HELP EITHER. THE DELUSIONAL MEDIA ARE NOW TRYING TO PULL A FAST BALL ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAYING TRUMP HAS BEEN REJECTED, THIS HAS BEEN A MASSIVE BLUE WAVE. HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN CONTAINED BY SOME IMAGINARY BLUE WAVE. IN HISTORICAL TERMS, IT WAS A TRICKLE. SOME DEMOCRATS REFUSING TO EVEN CALL THE ELECTION LEGITIMATE IN RACES THAT DIDN\'T GO THEIR WAY. WE SAW THAT IN GEORGIA IN THE GOVERNOR\'S RACE. BRIAN CAMP WON OUTRIGHT, BUT STACY ABRAMS SAID IN GEORGIA DID NOT HAVE A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION AND BRIAN CAMP DISMANTLED THE DEMOCRACY. REALLY CLASSY. IT SOUNDS LIKE A SORE LOSERRISM. ACCORDING TO FOX\'S ACCOUNT, THE DEMOCRATS WON 232 SEATS IN THE HOUSE COMPARED TO 199 FOR THE REPUBLICANS. MORE RACES YET TO BE CALLED. THEY PICKED UP 37 SEATS FOR THE DEMOCRATS, BUT THEY LOST ALL THOSE SEATS AND CLAIRE McCASKILL IS OUT, AND NELSON IS OUT, AND DONNELLY IS OUT. OH, YEAH. SO, PRESIDENT TRUMP, IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT NUMBERS AND HISTORY DID CONSIDERABLY IT MASSIVELY BETTER THE PREVIOUS TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS. 2010, OBAMA\'S FIRST MIDTERM. DEMOCRATIC LOST 63 SEATS IN THE HOUSE, \'94, BILL CLINTON LOST 52 SEATS IN THE HOUSE AND ATE IN THE SENATE. BEAR IN MIND, THE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY ADDED TO THEIR SENATE MAJORITY AND BY THE WAY, THAT NUMBER IS LIKELY TO GROW NEXT WEEK. AN IMPORTANT ELECTION. IF YOU ARE IN MISSISSIPPI, THAT SPECIAL ELECTION, NOVEMBER 27TH. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE STUMPING FOR HYDE SMITH IN HER BID TO BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT VOTE IF YOU LIVE THERE. THIS IS A BIG RACE.

Senior Pastor James Pennington says he\'s had a hard time understanding some of the decisions made by President Trump when it comes to immigration policy I think these immigrants and these refugees would be really contributing to our culture and to our society and I really think it\'s important to consider that so if it does if he does and is allowed to because supposedly he can make those decisions and those edicts I just think it\'s that healthy for our country because we can\'t you know we just can\'t close our doors and our hearts to people that are seeking a better life according to Minister Pennington the number of immigrants being released into their care by ice has gone up considerably in the last few weeks First Church UCC also had the designation of a sanctuary church for some time even before today\'s Asylum policy debate hundreds of migrants from the caravan have already arrived near port of entry in southern Arizona Douglas mayor Robert your I told kvo a that two busloads of Honduran migrants are now staying in shelters and private homes just across the border and Agua Prieta a Mexican official said some other buses from the caravan were turned back because aqua Prieta could not handle the influx of people President Trump might also give new authority to military troops who protect the border personnel in federal property it would allow the nearly 6,000 troops at the border to intervene and protect migrants if they engage in violence Airbnb has been a provider of living spaces for people looking for a place to rest their heads now the company is opening its doors to refugees here in Phoenix reporter cami Clark explains Airbnb s open homes program this house looks no different than any other here in Phoenix but this house is used to help house refugees through the Airbnb program open homes which has several partners including hospitality Services Center and the International Rescue Committee when IRC called and said Aaron B&amp;B; was asking if we would be able to cooperate with them we felt like that was a really good match the refugees stay in the home for about one to two weeks for free it\'s just part of the services the IRC offers here in Phoenix we help resettle refugees from around the world when they first arrived in Phoenix we help them find housing employment healthcare education as of September 2018 Airbnb has been able to house more than 15,000 people through open homes according to their website during the winter time it can be harder to house refugees here in Phoenix Airbnb is making an effort to get more hosts cheering from someone you trust about something like this is so so impactful and so we\'re trying to spread the word person by person neighborhood by neighborhood because we know there\'s a huge interest in Phoenix in helping so there may be some uncertainty about who is coming into your home the safety of open homes help refugees many from the war-torn Congo settle into new lives they\'re fleeing violence and they\'re looking for a safe place to land so I think that\'s probably the biggest hurdle to get over is in people\'s minds who the refugees are and is it safe to have them in my

and shows us resources available for those who might need it trans Day of Remembrance it\'s usually a very solemn day because we\'re remembering the the impact that stigma and transphobia has on our community still Michael Lewis is at Hayden lawn representing trans fam a club focused on helping transgender students find community and access to resources they identify as non-binary it\'s not cosmetic it\'s not a choice it\'s something we\'re born as and we just want to live today Hayden lawn visual displays remember those who have lost their lives this year due to transphobic violence which is violence that relates to a person\'s gender identity according to gayatri Gary Rajan the director of community coordination for the rainbow coalition at ASU there are a lot of ways violence can be inflicted upon people who identify as transgender a lot of transgender people like experience in intimate partner violence there\'s a lot of just like street violence there\'s a lot of violence due to the professions that trans people often trans women of color are forced to kind of be a part of because of the criminalization of those of their like identities and lack of like access to jobs because of discrimination diri Rajan says transphobic violence can take forms aside from just physical being misgendered every day or being like denied like the ability to like express yourself as you you know truly are Lewis says their group wants to support transgender individuals in the end everything will be okay and you have a community and you have family here who will love and support you

news we report the facts and stick to the truth it\'s a little change to the law that supporters could solve a big issue for one Arizona tribe Lilly and Donahue in our Washington bureau has the latest on a bill that\'s under consideration in the Senate the Gila River federal rights of way easements and boundary clarification Act would give the Gila River Indian Community 3400 acres if it passes solving a long-standing trust issue between the United States government and the tribe every Tribal Nation has come to a point of dealing with either mismanagement or under managed record-keeping and it\'s that mismanagement of Records and Trust lands by the government that has made infrastructure planning difficult for tribal leaders in the Gila River Indian community the House bill now pending in the Senate is in response to a lawsuit filed by the tribe a decade ago to regain land and trust rights they say were encroached upon more than a century before almost 150 years later the Gila River Indian community sought resolution in the court and ultimately the Department of Interior agreed to a settlement they want to make sure sacred sites are protected by them and not outside influences and this will allow for that to occur representative Tom o\'halleran introduced the bill and says it\'s just one part of a larger effort to right wrongs that have lingered in Indian country for too long it\'s a never-ending process right now and it\'s not been I think the Congress has not done this job over the last number of decades the Gila River Indian community is located south of the valley stretching from Goodyear to past Queen Creek councilman Barney Ennis jr. says that the tribe wants to be good neighbors to Phoenix while also restoring rights to their people and one of her 1 preserve but also to ensure that the the folks affected by this not become victims of dispute in Washington Lillian Donohue Cronkite news the bill would prohibit gaming on the affected land but while the bill has already passed the house time is running out in the Senate which is only scheduled to be in session for three more weeks for decades a piece of land on Phoenix\'s Southside has hid the secrets of hundreds of early Latino settlers who helped build the city many of them buried in a place that seems long-forgotten Cronkite news reporter Brittany Watson talked with activists and community members who are speaking out in hoping this piece of the city\'s history gets the recognition it deserves vandalized trashed abandoned this unmarked field is the final resting place for over 300 Mexican pioneers who spent their lives helping build Phoenix in its early days this nondescript patch of land located off 12th Street in Broadway is actually the Sotelo heard cemetery with its earliest recorded burial dating back to the late 1800s Phoenix wouldn\'t be what it is today if it wasn\'t for those people who were the foundation of the City of Phoenix and and somehow we forget that many residents who live near Sotelo her don\'t even know their homes are just yards away from a cemetery a place where many children were also buried some of those who do know say they\'ve seen this final resting place get trashed it often see people writing their motorbikes and running across the field throwing rocks and messing around I don\'t think they had an idea of being a cemetery the Pioneer Cemetery Association has worked to preserve historic cemeteries like Sotelo herd by salvaging and removing what they can of the damaged headstones to try and preserve what little is left Litchfield Park resident Ellie Roman has spent years researching her ancestors eventually finding out that eight of them were buried at Sotelo heard a cemetery that she had never even heard of before I was really really surprised we had so many family members there but it made sense they were ranchers laborers they worked the herd ranch my different branches of the fan they\'ve all been here it seems like from the early 1900\'s but a lot has changed since that time currently the cemetery is enclosed on two sides leaving the other two sides exposed representatives from the nonprofit organization that own this land say that they do not have the money to finish all the improvements that are still needed the nonprofit organization trellis owns the land where the cemetery sits they were supposed to build low-income housing on part of the property but that clearly hasn\'t happened unfortunately the market crashed and to this day we haven\'t built anything but we have just maintained the land the Pioneer Cemetery Association in trellis have proposed improvements including building an iron fence along the south and west perimeters having a monument in adding an entrance to the cemetery on 12th Street the repairs will cost thousands of dollars the main question now is where will that money come from we need everyone\'s help to raise the funding to finish this beautification project for sabelo Hurd cemetery to know that their babies or family members are there not to have that respect is just heartbreaking in Phoenix Brittany Watson Cronkite news representatives from both trellis and the Pioneer Cemetery Association say they have plans to speak with the Phoenix City Council about taking ownership of the land and maintaining the cemetery there\'s still no set date on when that meeting will take place the California condor faced extinction as recently as two decades ago but coming up on Cronkite news find out how the species is making a comeback holiday season is finally

efforts are still ongoing in California as forest fires continue to burn across the state the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the campfire in Northern California is now 70% contained and more help could be on the way rain is expected in the area later this week which could help the ongoing fight however officials warn that this could lead to flash flooding and mudslides earlier this fall for California condors were released by the Peregrine fund at Vermilion Cliffs National Monument next month more condors will be released in California Cronkite news reporter Emily 4 explains these releases are part of an ongoing effort to bring the condors back from the brink of extinction I just ended up kind of falling in love with it nadia co faith conservation and science associate for the santa barbara zoo is reminiscing about California condors seal faith works to understand condors and their nesting habits by 1987 all 22 condors left in the wild were taken into captive breeding an attempt to save them from extinction it\'s not only a fascinating species but it\'s been a fascinating program to work with through the US Fish and Wildlife Service and other organizations like the Ventana Wildlife Society California condors have since been reintroduced into the wild and their population is slowly growing in fact this year is really exciting because this year we had a record number of nests in Southern California there was 12 that\'s the most of any that we would we know historically yet condors are still battling they\'re leading cause of death lead poisoning condors are scavengers and eat the remains of animals killed by hunters the only issue is that led ammunition fragments into many many many tiny pieces inside a carcass rachael Wolstenholme manages the Condor program at pinnacles National Park she says she doesn\'t want to discourage hunting but she wants to offer alternatives to lead ammunition there\'s copper bismuth rifle ammunition there\'s also steel shot if people are using lead shot right now like in a shotgun they\'re still shot but Wolstenholme is hopeful California condors will be taken off the endangered species list in the near future I\'ve seen six or seven flying just over the high peaks there I like to say less than a decade I actually know we could get there sooner it\'s all about making sure that they have a clean food resource there are currently 44 California condors managed by pinnacles National Park in December three more will be released from this site we do what\'s called a soft release and so what we do will open the trap door so they can leave when they\'re ready joint efforts and successful releases keep wolfson home and seal faith motivated it\'s just been so clobbered have been it\'s so great to see so many people you know wanting this bird to succeed and I think that\'s just been really special to be a part of in Los Angeles Emily for Cronkite news there are five Condor release sites in North America one of them right here at the Vermillion cliffs in Arizona condors can also be seen at the Grand Canyon Horseshoe Bend is not only one of the most scenic spots in Arizona it\'s also one of the most popular leading to huge problems with parking a National Park Service plan to expand parking is now under way but the city of Page has had to close the north parking lot for construction and place other restrictions until the project is complete in March but for now tour buses with more than 20 passengers won\'t be able to park on site and people will be prohibited from parking along u.s. 89 it\'s Thanksgiving week here in Phoenix that\'s right let\'s go to Alexis and the Weather Center to see how the weather will be for this holiday alexis good afternoon everyone it

media veterans that shape the top journalists of tomorrow VI is looking to hire 900 new special agents everyone is encouraged to apply but as our reporter Anthony toll tree found out there are some requirements you\'ve gotta meet the FBI fit test for events 12 points required to pass improve you meet the physical standards to make it as an FBI agent this test was designed to push that and lets you know that yes physically you can handle this you can handle the firearms aspect of it you could handle the defensive tactics aspect of it if you do engage with a perpetrator of some sort of a subject that\'s you\'re after this test for the person who stays in shape and takes care of themselves should not be difficult I go to the gym a few days a week so I figured how hard could it be well the test starts off with 60 seconds of sit-ups slow harder than journalism at 47 in a minute earned me four points next up the 300 meter run a time of forty eight point two seconds added another three points to my total halfway done seven points Supervisory Special Agent as Elle Grigsby says there is one simple key to passing the test train this is this is one portion of the process that you have the answers to the test back to my exam for push-ups similar to the first event the goal is to do as many as possible but in this part of the test there is no time limit just do as many as you can till you can\'t go up anymore way less than I thought only got one point for my 32 FBI approved push-ups putting me at eight points heading into the final step not too far off from jumping from

Senior Pastor James Pennington says he\'s had a hard time understanding some of the decisions made by President Trump when it comes to immigration policy I think these immigrants and these refugees would be really contributing to our culture and to our society and I really think it\'s important to consider that so if it does if he does and is allowed to because supposedly he can make those decisions and those edicts I just think it\'s that healthy for our country because we can\'t you know we just can\'t close our doors and our hearts to people that are seeking a better life according to Minister Pennington the number of immigrants being released into their care by ice has gone up considerably in the last few weeks First Church UCC also had the designation of a sanctuary church for

busloads of Honduran migrants are now staying in shelters and private homes just across the border and Agua Prieta a Mexican official said some other buses from the caravan were turned back because aqua Prieta could not handle the influx of people President Trump might also give new authority to military troops who protect the border personnel in federal property it would allow the nearly 6,000

opening its doors to refugees here in Phoenix reporter cami Clark explains Airbnb s open homes program this house looks no different than any other here in Phoenix but this house is used to help house refugees through the Airbnb program open homes which has several partners including hospitality Services Center and the International Rescue Committee when IRC called and said Aaron B&amp;B; was asking if we would be able to cooperate with them we felt like that was a really good match the refugees stay in the home for about one to two weeks for free it\'s just part of the services the IRC offers here in Phoenix we help resettle refugees from around the world when they first arrived in Phoenix we help them find housing employment healthcare education as of September 2018 Airbnb has been able to house more than 15,000 people through open homes according to their website during the winter time it can be harder to house refugees here in Phoenix Airbnb is making an effort to get more hosts cheering from someone you trust about something like this is so so impactful and so we\'re trying to spread the word person by person neighborhood by neighborhood because we know there\'s a huge interest in Phoenix in helping so there may be some uncertainty about who is coming into your home the safety of open homes help refugees many from the war-torn Congo settle into new lives they\'re fleeing violence and they\'re looking for a safe place to land so I think that\'s probably the biggest hurdle to get over is in people\'s minds who the refugees are and is it safe to have them in my

which is violence that relates to a person\'s gender identity according to gayatri Gary Rajan the director of community coordination for the rainbow coalition at ASU there are a lot of ways violence can be inflicted upon people who identify as transgender a lot of transgender people like experience in intimate partner violence there\'s a lot of just like street violence there\'s a lot of violence due to the professions that trans people often trans women of color are forced to kind of be a part of because of the criminalization of those of their like identities and lack of like access to jobs because of discrimination diri Rajan says transphobic violence can take forms aside from just physical being misgendered every day or being like denied like the ability to like express yourself as you you know truly are Lewis says their group wants to support transgender individuals in the end everything will be okay and you have a community and you have family here who will love and support you

news we report the facts and stick to the truth it\'s a little change to the law that supporters could solve a big issue for one Arizona tribe Lilly and Donahue in our Washington bureau has the latest on a bill that\'s under consideration in the Senate the Gila River federal rights of way easements and boundary clarification Act would give the Gila River Indian Community 3400 acres if it passes solving a long-standing trust issue between the United States government and the tribe every Tribal Nation has come to a point of dealing with either mismanagement or under managed record-keeping and it\'s that mismanagement of Records and Trust lands by the government that has made infrastructure planning difficult for tribal leaders in the Gila River Indian community the House bill now pending in the Senate is in response to a lawsuit filed by the tribe a decade ago to regain land and trust rights they say were encroached upon more than a century before almost 150 years later the Gila River Indian community sought resolution in the court and ultimately the Department of Interior agreed to a settlement they want to make sure sacred sites are protected by them and not outside influences and this will allow for that to occur representative Tom o\'halleran introduced the bill and says it\'s just one part of a larger effort to right wrongs that have lingered in Indian country for too long it\'s a never-ending process right now and it\'s not been I think the Congress has not done this job over the last number of decades the Gila River Indian community is located south of the valley

but also to ensure that the the folks affected by this not become victims of dispute in Washington Lillian Donohue Cronkite news the bill would prohibit gaming on the affected land but while the bill has already passed the house time is running out in the Senate which is only scheduled to be in session for three more weeks for decades a piece of land on Phoenix\'s Southside has hid the secrets of hundreds of early Latino settlers who helped build the city many of them buried in a place that seems long-forgotten Cronkite news reporter Brittany Watson talked with activists and community members who are speaking out in hoping this piece of the city\'s history gets the recognition it deserves vandalized trashed abandoned this unmarked field is the final resting place for over 300 Mexican pioneers who spent their lives helping build Phoenix in its early days this nondescript patch of land located off 12th Street in Broadway is actually the Sotelo heard cemetery with its earliest recorded burial dating back to the late 1800s Phoenix wouldn\'t be what it is today if it wasn\'t for those people who were the foundation of the City of Phoenix and and somehow we forget that many residents who live near Sotelo her don\'t even know their homes are just yards away from a cemetery a place where many children were also buried some of those who do know say they\'ve seen this final resting place get trashed it often see people writing their motorbikes and running across the field throwing rocks and messing around I don\'t think they had an idea of being a cemetery the Pioneer Cemetery Association has worked to preserve historic cemeteries like Sotelo herd by salvaging and removing what they can of the damaged headstones to try and preserve what little is left Litchfield Park resident Ellie Roman has spent years researching her ancestors eventually finding out that eight of them were buried at Sotelo heard a cemetery that she had never even heard of before I was really really surprised we had so many family members there but it made sense they were ranchers laborers they worked the herd ranch my different branches of the fan they\'ve all been here it seems like from the early 1900\'s but a lot has changed since that time currently the cemetery is enclosed on two sides leaving the other two sides exposed representatives from the nonprofit organization that own this land say that they do not have the money to finish all the improvements that are still needed the nonprofit organization trellis owns the land where the cemetery sits they were supposed to build low-income housing on part of the property but that clearly hasn\'t happened unfortunately the market crashed and to this day we haven\'t built anything but we have just maintained the land the Pioneer Cemetery Association in trellis have proposed improvements including building an iron fence along the south and west perimeters having a monument in adding an entrance to the cemetery on 12th Street the repairs will cost thousands of dollars the main question now is where will that money come from we need everyone\'s help to raise the funding to finish this beautification project for sabelo Hurd cemetery to know that their babies or family members are there not to have that respect is just heartbreaking in Phoenix Brittany Watson Cronkite news representatives from both trellis and the Pioneer Cemetery Association say they have plans to speak with the Phoenix City Council about taking ownership of the land and maintaining the cemetery there\'s still no set date on when that meeting will take place the California condor faced extinction as recently as two decades ago but coming up on Cronkite news find out how the species is making a comeback holiday season is finally

efforts are still ongoing in California as forest fires continue to burn across the state the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the campfire in Northern California is now 70%

earlier this fall for California condors were released by the Peregrine fund at Vermilion Cliffs National Monument next month more condors will be released in California Cronkite news reporter Emily 4 explains these releases are part of an ongoing effort to bring the condors back from the brink of extinction I just ended up kind of falling in love with it nadia co faith conservation and science associate for the santa barbara zoo is reminiscing about California condors seal faith works to understand condors and their nesting habits by 1987 all 22 condors left in the wild were taken into captive breeding an attempt to save them from extinction it\'s not only a fascinating species but it\'s been a fascinating program to work with through the US Fish and Wildlife Service and other organizations like the Ventana Wildlife Society California condors have since been reintroduced into the wild and their population is slowly growing in fact this year is really exciting because this year we had a record number of nests in Southern California there was 12 that\'s the most of any that we would we know historically yet condors are still battling they\'re leading cause of death lead poisoning condors are scavengers and eat the remains of animals killed by hunters the only issue is that led ammunition fragments into many many many tiny pieces inside a carcass rachael Wolstenholme manages the Condor program at pinnacles National Park she says she doesn\'t want to discourage hunting but she wants to offer alternatives to lead ammunition there\'s copper bismuth rifle ammunition there\'s also steel shot if people are using lead shot right now like in a shotgun they\'re still shot but Wolstenholme is hopeful California condors will be taken off the endangered species list in the near future I\'ve seen six or seven flying just over the high peaks there I like to say less than a decade I actually know we could get there sooner it\'s all about making sure that they have a clean food resource there are currently 44 California condors managed by pinnacles National Park in December three more will be released from this site we do what\'s called a soft release and so what we do will open the trap door so they can leave when they\'re ready joint efforts and successful releases keep wolfson home and seal faith motivated it\'s just been so clobbered have been it\'s so great to see so many people you know wanting this bird to succeed and I think that\'s just been really special to be a part of in Los Angeles Emily for Cronkite news there are five Condor release

points to my total halfway done seven points Supervisory Special Agent as Elle Grigsby says there is one simple key to passing the test train this is this is one portion of the process that you have the answers to the test back to my exam for push-ups similar to the first event the goal is to do as many as possible but in this part of the test there is no time limit just do as many as you can

Trump wrote today in part we may never know all the facts surrounding the murder of - jamol keshavjee in any case our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the president said that maybe the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the murder or maybe he didn\'t yet the CIA has concluded not only that he knew but that he ordered the brutal killing lawmakers are putting pressure on the White House to punish the Saudis both Republicans and Democrats and US allies are doing the same so the President may not have the last say we\'re waiting for the full report from the CIA but today the president got a head of his intelligence agencies in essence for now it doesn\'t matter what Intel says we\'re standing with the Saudi Kingdom John Roberts reporting live from the White House and we expected the president may stop and talk with the assembled media outside the South portico as he departs from mar-a-lago this afternoon I don\'t imagine he would leave for Thanksgiving chef without a few parting words and he\'ll certainly be asked some questions about his statement regarding Jamal khashoggi which appears to side with the us-saudi relationship rather than what we\'re hearing about the substance of Jamal khashoggi shmurda the president saying in a statement quote King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of mr. khashoggi our intelligence agencies continue to assess all the information but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event maybe he did and maybe he didn\'t if that sounds familiar that\'s exactly what he told Chris Wallace last Friday in an interview in the statement the president said he didn\'t want to risk the relationship with Saudi Arabia hundreds of billions of dollars in military and commercial deals at stake pointing out that 17 Saudis involved in the murder have already been sanctioned by the United States the Secretary of State in the last hour backing up the president saying it\'s a mean and nasty world out there and the president needs to have relationships with countries like Saudi Arabia the president also raised questions about khashoggi himself though going some distance to impugn khashoggi z\' reputation writing quote representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal could show you was quote an enemy of the state and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood but the president going on to say my decision is in no way based on that this is an unacceptable and horrible crime but he put the information out there in an official presidential statement the president in that statement chef also recognizing that Congress is likely going to do its own investigation and may have some recommendations for him the president saying he will look at those recommendations quote but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America the president also saying that Saudi Arabia remains quote a great ally chef John Roberts reporting from the White House Ivanka Trump while a government employee as assistant to the president sent hundreds of emails to government officials from a personal account even after her father spent many months attacking Hillary Clinton about private emails that\'s according to the reporting of the Washington Post the paper reports the first daughter and presidential adviser used her personal email to contact White House aides and cabinet members and others and that when asked about it she said she was unaware of the rules again even though her father made Hillary Clinton\'s emails a driving force in his campaign he called for Hillary Clinton to be put in jail again and again of course there are differences in these two cases they are numerous Ivanka Trump is not accused of using a private email server she\'s not accused of deleting any emails she\'s not accused of sending classified information but the Washington Post reports the similarities were enough to worry some of the president\'s own advisers the House Oversight Committee under the Republican leadership investigated Hillary Clinton\'s email habits now the incoming chairman of that committee indicated that it will investigate Ivanka Trump back to the chief White House correspondent John Robertson here we go and that is a distinction too that representatives for Ivanka Trump are making today Shep as well the differences between her use of a private email and Hillary Clinton\'s but certainly Ivanka Trump through her representatives is acknowledging that for a time when she first joined the White House last year she continued to use a private email address to do White House business but her attorney Abbey Lowell through spokesman Peter Mary Jane Ian saying quote she did not create a private server in her house or office there was never classified information transmitted the account was never transferred or housed at the Trump Organization no emails were ever deleted and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation rules and laws this first came to light little more than a year ago probably 14 months ago when stories hit about Jared Kushner using a joint family account it\'s i JK family calm to send emails related to White House business at that point Ivanka Trump informed the White House Counsel that she had been using a private that same private email address but not for any classified information she also briefed leaders of Congress on this but Shep a lot of people are sort of raising an eyebrow to say how is it that she was not aware of the rules regarding the use of private email for government business when her father made such a point of it for so many months during the campaign a campaign of which she was a frequent attendee Shep is quite a thing John Roberts thank you when President Trump issued an executive order to change asylum laws in America he essentially said since Congress has enacted I will now a federal judge has countered no you won\'t the judge today blocked the administration from denying asylum to immigrants across the southern border illegally the ruling the obvious Congress makes and changes the laws the president can act as a matter of national security and that\'s exactly what he\'s claiming the caravan the invasion the troops the threat to the nation the judge said no the president cannot simply rewrite immigration laws again John Roberts on a busy day at the White House and the administration is pushing back Shep against that ruling from San Francisco Judge John tiger where the judge came forward and said well you can write all the executive actions you want but you can\'t go against US law and the statement saying quote the rule barring asylum for immigrants who entered the country outside of a port of entry irreconcilably conflicts with the Immigration and Naturalization Act and the expressed intent of Congress whatever the scope of the president\'s authority he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden the Department of Homeland Security vigorously disagreed with that in a statement this morning saying quote asylum is a discretionary benefit given by the executive branch it is lawful and appropriate that this discretionary benefit not be given to those who violate a lawful and tailored presidential proclamation aimed at controlling immigration in the national interest Judge tiger put in place a nationwide restraining order which will likely mean that a lot of those migrants in the caravan who have been waiting outside of the port of entry in San Ysidro California may make for the nearby hills and try to cross into the border illegally and in that action coincides with an order that was given to the Pentagon from the White House today chef that if Customs and Border Protection officers come under attack the US military backing them up is authorized to use force so we\'ll see which way this goes chef John Roberts thank you the military is now pushing back on reports that the 5800 troops that President Trump sent to the border should be home by Christmas the army commander who oversees troops on the southern border told that to Politico but the US Army responded with an official statement indicating only that it may shift some of its forces to other areas of the border and today some new talk on timing our national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reporting live from the Pentagon hi chef well as John Roberts just reported a

more to come on that and again the president is speaking right now at the White House we\'ll have the tape turn around also talking I\'ve just been told he\'s just spoken about Ivanka Trump and her emails different tone guessing we\'ll see in a moment stay with us breaking news now on Fox News Channel this is the scene from a mansion in the New York City suburb of Colts Neck New Jersey about 30 miles south of the city fully engulfed officials say there are multiple fatalities but this is more than a house fire the local NBC own television station W NBC here in New York City is reporting that crews found one person shot dead outside that home they also found two other bodies inside the building but at this moment it\'s not clear whether those people died from the fire or whether they were also shot this neighborhood is a very rich one home to many celebrities and wealthy folks who who work here in the city details are sort of sketchy on this except a house fire and someone shot dead in the front yard expect to hear much more on this to come first the fire and now the flood people in Northern California bracing for flash floods and mudslides after the state\'s deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record incinerated entire communities 79 people are now confirmed dead in the small town of Paradise and the surrounding area forecasters say heavy rain is on the way which could help put out the fires but it could also bring even more devastation to a place that already looks like a post-apocalyptic wasteland take a look at this satellite image this is a neighborhood in the town of Paradise from a couple of months ago and look at this that\'s the neighborhood now after the inferno devoured it Claudia Cowan reporting live from a shelter in Chico Claudia and Shepard thousands of fire evacuees are making the best of things at shelters like this one at a church here in Chico donated supplies are helping about 200 people who for now are staying at the gym here these folks are also getting medical attention and mental health counseling two more sets of human remains were found yesterday increasing the number of deaths from the camp fire to 79 the number of those unaccounted for has dropped to about 700 but search crews warned some people may never be found due to the intensity of the flames with evacuation orders now being lifted in some areas around Paradise residents are returning to sift through the rubble of what used to be their home the state\'s insurance commissioner says the losses are staggering in 2017 from all the California fires there was 12 point six billion dollars in insured losses and that was only 6800 single-family homes destroyed here we\'re approaching 11,000 single-family homes destroyed so this is a much more deadly much more destructive fire and insured losses are going to be a lot greater Jones says his office is also educating people about how to avoid getting scammed for instance by unlicensed contractors promising a quick home rebuild bottom line this recovery is going to take years and officials say people should be wary of shortcuts because they say it could cost them more in long run and now rain threatens to bring another kind of disaster yes it will clear out this unhealthy air and yes it will put out what is left of the fire but rain will almost certainly hamper ongoing search and recovery efforts and officials are especially concerned Shepard that a heavy downpour could trigger mudslides Claudia Cowan reporting from Chico California ahead more on Fox top story the killing of Jamaal keshavjee lawmakers from the United States and leaders from abroad calling for the president to do something about it and new information on the government warning you should throw out your romaine lettuce immediately and the none of it there\'s food poisoning there\'s an e coli outbreak the CDC\'s warning is brand new and a live look at the White House where the president is still speaking he\'s just spoken on the four-star general McRaven who the president has called a Hillary backer who led the operations and commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and killed her sama bin Laden he has said that the president\'s sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy of his lifetime and now the president moments ago is refusing to call him a hero there\'s lots of news coming from the White House and we\'ll play it back for you in a moment [Music] now the breaking details that we\'ve been talking about throughout this hour we\'ve got the warning just about 2 minutes to 3 o\'clock Eastern Time two days before Thanksgiving the feds are warning romaine lettuce is not safe to eat in any form and they\'re being specific it doesn\'t matter where or when you bought it it doesn\'t matter if it\'s chopped or hole or part of a salad or even a single leaf on your cheeseburger it doesn\'t matter if somebody already ate part of a stash of romaine and didn\'t get sick at all throw it all away and do not consume one bit it\'s a pointed and specific warning in other words now on the CDC website officials there say it\'s because at least 32 people at least 32 in 11 different states are very sick with a dangerous type of e-coli Jonathan hunt reporting on the latest as we have at Jonathan Shep the alert was just issued an hour ago Datelin p.m. eastern from the CDC and it is stark in its warnings saying quote CDC is advising that US consumers not eat any romaine lettuce and retailers and restaurants not serve or sell any they\'re also advising that all romaine that any consumer has been thrown out including any salad mixes containing any romaine and all shelves or drawers where that romaine might have been stored not just be washed but also sanitized the CDC says the bad romaine can lead to e coli infections and 32 people across 11 states are recorded as becoming sick in this latest outbreak with cases from October 8th to October 31st of those 13 people have been hospitalized with one patient suffering a form of kidney failure now it\'s important to note this is entirely separate to the remain linked e.coli outbreak that lasted from March to June of this year 210 cases were identified in that outbreak across 36 states and five people died then the outbreak was traced to Yuma Arizona but this warning is unusually broad because the CDC has not at this point being able to identify where the infected roam is coming from so the bottom line here Shep do not eat any romaine anywhere get it out of your fridge or off your shelves wipe those shelves down with antibacterial wipes and if you have any stomach illness symptoms write down everything you\'ve eaten in the last week according to the CDC get to a doctor and get all the information to public health investigators this is a serious and urgent alert from the CDC and as we saw in that earlier outbreak this year the e.coli from infected romaine can kill so the message plain and simple from the CDC do not take any chances chef Jonathan hunt thank you back to Fox top story the fallout over the death of Jamaal keshavjee Republicans Democrats some US allies overseas all at Praia plying enormous pressure on the president to get tougher on Saudi Arabia the president said the US would probably release a full report on The Washington Post columnist death by today we\'re still waiting for that report but we did get a statement from the president saying that he stands not with our intelligence agencies but with Saudi Arabia Benjamin Hall with the follow up live from London yeah hi Shep you know for two days what we\'ve been waiting for is this report from the CIA about whether or not Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the death of Jamarcus yogi in advance and if so how perhaps the president should move forward instead what we got was this statement from President Trump very clearly saying that he was going to put national security first and laying out all the threats that the u.s. faced in the Middle East and how they could work with Saudi Arabia to counter some of those this has always been the rhetoric from Saudi Arabia as well the importance of the relationship the issues they work on fighting radical terror Intelligence Sharing working in Yemen pushing back Iran against across the region and more Saudi Arabia has not yet responded to the statement but earlier today the foreign minister commented saying quote we in the Kingdom know that such allegations about the crown prince have no basis in the truth and we categorically reject them President Trump also repeats some of the we\'ve seen in Saudi media that Jamal Khashoggi was an enemy of the state and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he makes it clear that his decision was not based on that but Saudi Arabia in the US have always had a deep shared distrust of the Muslim Brotherhood and the political Islam it espouses and that\'s certainly one of the threats that President Trump aims to work on together with Saudi Arabia in Turkey meanwhile details continue to emerge about Khashoggi x\' death with Turkish media releasing what it claims are quotes from the tape of Khashoggi x\' killing now in it the leader of that Saudi team is claimed to shout traitor you will be brought to account and after that apparently the rest of the tape is filled with verbal fighting brawling and torture there\'s also been anger among journalists today since the statement with the Committee to Protect Journalists saying quote if you boil the White House statement down to its essence President Trump has just asserted that if you do enough business with the US you are free to murder journalists so quite a lot of anger among the journalists community particularly abroad whether other countries are going to follow suit and and make statements of their own we\'ve yet to see but certainly today President Trump saying for him national security is the first and foremost concern and the relationship with Saudi Arabia is the key to that in the Middle East yep Benjamin Hall reporting live from London the president the president has just finished speaking to reporters about the keshavjee case he also talked about general McRaven he also just talked about his new department of the head of department of justice so there\'s a lot of news coming the White House pool will now get that to a playback machine and will play it back on air the president has just left on marine one he\'s headed for this plane to take him down to the Palm Beaches for the holidays and should this White House play back begin during the commercial we will interrupt the commercial for the playback now now that you [Music] a tremendous fortune like you\'ve never seen before but it\'s someday I\'ll tell you what that is but and I do that a long time ago because I don\'t do deals I don\'t do all I do is focus on this country and making great deals for this country I don\'t focus on making great deals for myself because I don\'t care anymore so Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me what does have to do with me is putting America first wait wait wait wait they\'re buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth of things from this country if I say we don\'t want to take your business if I say we\'re going to cut it off they will get the equipment military equipment and other things from Russia and China Russia and China would be very very happy because right now we\'re doing very well against China we\'re doing very well against everybody including Russia and I\'m going to keep it that way and I\'m not going to tell a country that\'s spending hundreds of billions of dollars and has helped me do one thing very importantly keep oil prices down so that they\'re not going to a hundred and one hundred and fifty dollars a barrel right now we have oil prices in great shape I\'m not going to destroy the world economy and I\'m not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia so I think this statement wait a minute I think the statement was pretty obvious what I said it\'s about America first are you saying it again the bunker you know why was it just so you understand early on and for a little period of time Ivanka did some emails they weren\'t classified like Hillary Clinton they weren\'t deleted like Hillary Clinton who deleted 33 she wasn\'t hiring she wasn\'t doing anything to hide her email I looked at it just very briefly today and the presidential records they\'re all in presidential records there was no hiding there was no deleting like Hillary Clinton did there was no service in the basement like Hillary Clinton had you\'re talking about a whole different you\'re talking about all fake news so what Ivanka did it\'s all in the presidential records everything is there there was no deletion there was no nothing what it is is a false story Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails she had a server in the basement that\'s the real

Trump wrote today in part we may never know all the facts surrounding the murder of - jamol keshavjee in any case our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the president said that maybe the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the murder or maybe he didn\'t yet the CIA has concluded not only that he knew but that he ordered the brutal killing lawmakers are putting pressure on the White House to punish the Saudis both Republicans and Democrats and US allies are doing the same so the President may not have the last say we\'re waiting for the full report from the CIA but today the president got a head of his intelligence agencies in essence for now it doesn\'t matter what Intel says we\'re standing with the Saudi Kingdom John Roberts reporting live from the White House and we expected the president may stop and talk with the assembled media outside the South portico as he departs from mar-a-lago this afternoon I don\'t imagine he would leave for Thanksgiving chef without a few parting words and he\'ll certainly be asked some questions about his statement regarding Jamal khashoggi which appears to side with the us-saudi relationship rather than what we\'re hearing about the substance of Jamal khashoggi shmurda the president saying in a statement quote King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of mr. khashoggi our intelligence agencies continue to assess all the information but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event maybe he did and maybe he didn\'t if that sounds familiar that\'s exactly what he told Chris Wallace last Friday in an interview in the statement the president said he didn\'t want to risk the relationship with Saudi Arabia hundreds of billions of dollars in military and commercial deals at stake pointing out that 17 Saudis involved in the murder have already been sanctioned by the United States the Secretary of State in the last hour backing up the president saying it\'s a mean and nasty world out there and the president needs to have relationships with countries like Saudi Arabia the president also raised questions about khashoggi himself though going some distance to impugn khashoggi z\' reputation writing quote representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal could show you was quote an enemy of the state and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood but the president going on to say my decision is in no way based on that this is an unacceptable and horrible crime but he put the information out there in an official presidential statement the president in that statement chef also recognizing that Congress is likely going to do its own investigation and may have some recommendations for him the president saying he will look at those recommendations quote but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America the president also saying that Saudi Arabia remains quote a great ally chef John Roberts reporting from the White House Ivanka Trump while a government employee as assistant to the president sent hundreds of emails to government officials from a personal account even after her father spent many months attacking Hillary Clinton about private emails that\'s according to the reporting of the Washington Post the paper reports the first daughter and presidential adviser used her personal email to contact White House aides and cabinet members and others and that when asked about it she said she was unaware of the rules again even though her father made Hillary Clinton\'s emails a driving force in his campaign he called for Hillary Clinton to be put in jail again and again of course there are differences in these two cases they are numerous Ivanka Trump is not accused of using a private email server she\'s not accused of deleting any emails she\'s not accused of sending classified information but the Washington Post reports the similarities were enough to worry some of the president\'s own advisers the House Oversight Committee under the Republican leadership investigated Hillary Clinton\'s email habits now the incoming chairman of that committee indicated that it will investigate Ivanka Trump back to the chief White House correspondent John Robertson here we go and that is a distinction too that representatives for Ivanka Trump are making today Shep as well the differences between her use of a private email and Hillary Clinton\'s but certainly Ivanka Trump through her representatives is acknowledging that for a time when she first joined the White House last year she continued to use a private email address to do White House business but her attorney Abbey Lowell through spokesman Peter Mary Jane Ian saying quote she did not create a private server in her house or office there was never classified information transmitted the account was never transferred or housed at the Trump Organization no emails were ever deleted and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation rules and laws this first came to light little more than a year ago probably 14 months ago when stories hit about Jared Kushner using a joint family account it\'s i JK family calm to send emails related to White House business at that point Ivanka Trump informed the White House Counsel that she had been using a private that same private email address but not for any classified information she also briefed leaders of Congress on this but Shep a lot of people are sort of raising an eyebrow to say how is it that she was not aware of the rules regarding the use of private email for government business when her father made such a point of it for so many months during the campaign a campaign of which she was a frequent attendee Shep is quite a thing John Roberts thank you when President Trump issued an executive order to change asylum laws in America he essentially said since Congress has enacted I will now a federal judge has countered no you won\'t the judge today blocked the administration from denying asylum to immigrants across the southern border illegally the ruling the obvious Congress makes and changes the laws the president can act as a matter of national security and that\'s exactly what he\'s claiming the caravan the invasion the troops the threat to the nation the judge said no the president cannot simply rewrite immigration laws again John Roberts on a busy day at the White House and the administration is pushing back Shep against that ruling from San Francisco Judge John tiger where the judge came forward and said well you can write all the executive actions you want but you can\'t go against US law and the statement saying quote the rule barring asylum for immigrants who entered the country outside of a port of entry irreconcilably conflicts with the Immigration and Naturalization Act and the expressed intent of Congress whatever the scope of the president\'s authority he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden the Department of Homeland Security vigorously disagreed with that in a statement this morning saying quote asylum is a discretionary benefit given by the executive branch it is lawful and appropriate that this discretionary benefit not be given to those who violate a lawful and tailored presidential proclamation aimed at controlling immigration in the national interest Judge tiger put in place a nationwide restraining order which will likely mean that a lot of those migrants in the caravan who have been waiting outside of the port of entry in San Ysidro California may make for the nearby hills and try to cross into the border illegally and in that action coincides with an order that was given to the Pentagon from the White House today chef that if Customs and Border Protection officers come under attack the US military backing them up is authorized to use force so we\'ll see which way this goes chef John Roberts thank you the military is now pushing back on reports that the 5800 troops that President Trump sent to the border should be home by Christmas the army commander who oversees troops on the southern border told that to Politico but the US Army responded with an official statement indicating only that it may shift some of its forces to other areas of the border and today some new talk on timing our national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reporting live from the Pentagon hi chef well as John Roberts just reported a day after a federal judge halted the Trump administration from refusing asylum to immigrants at the border a senior US official confirms to me that the president is preparing to sign off on additional

changed the signed orders from secretary mattis ordering the troops to the border restricted the troops activity to mostly engineering but now after much back and forth with Defense Department lawyers the White House was informed that the president could grant the troops additional authorities the US troops remain pretty far back from the border I\'m told and would be in a be a line of defense if

residents are returning to sift through the rubble of what used to be their home the state\'s insurance commissioner says the losses are staggering in 2017 from all the California fires there was 12 point six billion dollars in insured losses and that was only 6800 single-family homes destroyed here we\'re approaching 11,000 single-family homes destroyed so this is a much more deadly much more destructive fire and insured losses are going to be a lot greater Jones says his office is also educating people about how to avoid getting scammed for instance by unlicensed contractors promising a quick home rebuild bottom line this recovery is going to take years and officials say people should be wary of shortcuts because they say it could cost them more in long run and now rain threatens to bring another kind of disaster yes it will clear out this unhealthy air and yes it will put out what is left of the fire but rain will almost certainly hamper ongoing search and recovery efforts and officials are especially concerned Shepard that a heavy downpour could trigger mudslides Claudia Cowan reporting from Chico California ahead more on Fox top story the killing of Jamaal keshavjee lawmakers from the United States and leaders from abroad calling for the president to do something about it and new information on the government warning you should throw out your romaine lettuce immediately and the none of it there\'s food poisoning there\'s an e coli outbreak the CDC\'s warning is brand new and a live look at the White House where the president is still speaking he\'s just spoken on the four-star general McRaven who the president has called a Hillary backer who led the operations and commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and killed her sama bin Laden he has said that the president\'s sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy of his lifetime and now the president moments ago is refusing to call him a hero there\'s lots of news coming from the White House and we\'ll play it back for you in a moment [Music] now the breaking details that we\'ve been talking about throughout this hour we\'ve got the warning just about 2 minutes to 3 o\'clock Eastern Time two days before Thanksgiving the feds are warning romaine lettuce is not safe to eat in any form and they\'re being specific it doesn\'t matter where or when you bought it it doesn\'t matter if it\'s chopped or hole or part of a salad or even a single leaf on your cheeseburger it doesn\'t matter if somebody already ate part of a stash of romaine and didn\'t get sick at all throw it all away and do not consume one bit it\'s a pointed and specific warning in other words now on the CDC website officials there say it\'s because at least 32 people at least 32 in 11 different states are very sick with a dangerous type of e-coli Jonathan hunt reporting on the latest as we have at Jonathan Shep the alert was just issued an hour ago Datelin p.m. eastern from the CDC and it is stark in its warnings saying quote CDC is advising that US consumers not eat any romaine lettuce and retailers and restaurants not serve or sell any they\'re also advising that all romaine that any consumer has been thrown out including any salad mixes containing any romaine and all shelves or drawers where that romaine might have been stored not just be washed but also sanitized the CDC says the bad romaine can lead to e coli infections and 32 people across 11 states are recorded as becoming sick in this latest outbreak with cases from October 8th to October 31st of those 13 people have been hospitalized with one patient suffering a form of kidney failure now it\'s important to note this is entirely separate to the remain linked e.coli outbreak that lasted from March to June of this year 210 cases were identified in that outbreak across 36 states and five people died then the outbreak was traced to Yuma Arizona but this warning is unusually broad because the CDC has not at this point being able to identify where the infected roam is coming from so the bottom line here Shep do not eat any romaine anywhere get it out of your fridge or off your shelves wipe those shelves down with antibacterial wipes and if you have any stomach illness symptoms write down everything you\'ve eaten in the last week according to the CDC get to a doctor and get all the information to public health investigators this is a serious and urgent alert from the CDC and as we saw in that earlier outbreak this year the e.coli from infected romaine can kill so the message plain and simple from the CDC do not take any chances chef Jonathan hunt thank you back to Fox top story the fallout over the death of Jamaal keshavjee Republicans Democrats some US allies overseas all at Praia plying enormous pressure on the president to get tougher on Saudi Arabia the president said the US would probably release a full report on The Washington Post columnist death by today we\'re still waiting for that report but we did get a statement from the president saying that he stands not with our intelligence agencies but with Saudi Arabia Benjamin Hall with the follow up live from London yeah hi Shep you know for two days what we\'ve been waiting for is this report from the CIA about whether or not Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the death of Jamarcus yogi in advance and if so how perhaps the president should move forward instead what we got was this statement from President Trump very clearly saying that he was going to put national security first and laying out all the threats that the u.s. faced in the Middle East and how they could work with Saudi Arabia to counter some of those this has always been the rhetoric from Saudi Arabia as well the importance of the relationship the issues they work on fighting radical terror Intelligence Sharing working in Yemen pushing back Iran against across the region and more Saudi Arabia has not yet responded to the statement but earlier today the foreign minister commented saying quote we in the Kingdom know that such allegations about the crown prince have no basis in the truth and we categorically reject them President Trump also repeats some of the we\'ve seen in Saudi media that Jamal Khashoggi was an enemy of the state and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he makes it clear that his decision was not based on that but Saudi Arabia in the US have always had a deep shared distrust of the Muslim Brotherhood and the political Islam it espouses and that\'s certainly one of the threats that President Trump aims to work on together with Saudi Arabia in Turkey meanwhile details continue to emerge about Khashoggi x\' death with Turkish media releasing what it claims are quotes from the tape of Khashoggi x\' killing now in it the leader of that Saudi team is claimed to shout traitor you will be brought to account and after that apparently the rest of the tape is filled with verbal fighting brawling and torture there\'s also been anger among journalists today since the statement with the Committee to Protect Journalists saying quote if you boil the White House statement down to its essence President Trump has just asserted that if you do enough business with the US you are free to murder journalists so quite a lot of anger among the journalists community particularly abroad whether other countries are going to follow suit and and make statements of their own we\'ve yet to see but certainly today President Trump saying for him national security is the first and foremost concern and the relationship with Saudi Arabia is the key to that in the Middle East yep Benjamin Hall reporting live from London the president the president has just finished speaking to reporters about the keshavjee case he also talked about general McRaven he also just talked about his new department of the head of department of justice so there\'s a lot of news coming the White House pool will now get that to a playback machine and will play it back on air the president has just left on marine one he\'s headed for this plane to take him down to the Palm Beaches for the holidays and should this White House play back begin during the commercial we will interrupt the commercial for the playback now now that you [Music] a tremendous fortune like you\'ve never seen before but it\'s someday I\'ll tell you what that is but and I do that a long time ago because I don\'t do deals I don\'t do all I do is focus on this country and making great deals for this country I don\'t focus on making great deals for myself because I don\'t care anymore so Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me what does have to do with me is putting America first wait wait wait wait they\'re buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth of things from this country if I say we don\'t want to take your business if I say we\'re going to cut it off they will get the equipment military equipment and other things from Russia and China Russia and China would be very very happy because right now we\'re doing very well against China we\'re doing very well against everybody including Russia and I\'m going to keep it that way and I\'m not going to tell a country that\'s spending hundreds of billions of dollars and has helped me do one thing very importantly keep oil prices down so that they\'re not going to a hundred and one hundred and fifty dollars a barrel right now we have oil prices in great shape I\'m not going to destroy the world economy and I\'m not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia so I think this statement wait a minute I think the statement was pretty obvious what I said it\'s about America first are you saying it again the bunker you know why was it just so you understand early on and for a little period of time Ivanka did some emails they weren\'t classified like Hillary Clinton they weren\'t deleted like Hillary Clinton who deleted 33 she wasn\'t hiring she wasn\'t doing anything to hide her email I looked at it just very briefly today and the presidential records they\'re all in presidential records there was no hiding there was no deleting like Hillary Clinton did there was no service in the basement like Hillary Clinton had you\'re talking about a whole different you\'re talking about all fake news so what Ivanka did it\'s all in the presidential records everything is there there was no deletion there was no nothing what it is is a false story Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails she had a server in the basement that\'s the real story [Music] the witch policy is final', 'McRaven he also just talked about his new department of the head of department of justice so there\'s a lot of news coming the White House pool will now get

relationship with one of the victims and anther shoot he began in the parking lot when officers got there the gunman opened fire but they fired back there\'s no doubt in my mind and all those officers that responded were heroes and they saved a lot of lives because we just don\'t know how much damage he was prepared to do at this point it\'s unclear if the shooter was killed by police or by a self-inflicted gunshot wound much more on this story coming up on GMA a a crime and safety alert here in our area authorities in Oregon on the lookout for weapons that was stolen from a store in

money that was not spent in each district to that districts councilmember to spend on new projects it\'s not really easy for them under you know the prior way of doing things to request those dollars

waiting for years to get their sidewalk fix and we have not had the money we\'re bringing it back five of the six districts would get this unspent money district two would not receive any because its allotment of funding was used as budgeted now 13abc first warning weather with meteorologist Ross Ellet at a good Tuesday morning a look at those weather headlines we\'ve got the snow from overnight that is ending for this morning and the roads generally look just wet although there may be slick spot or two but the trees and the grass is coated with another layer of some white about a half inch of snow overnight by Thanksgiving we\'re going cold turkey here it\'s gonna be cold by the way if you put the turkey outside to thaw it will thaw it\'ll refreeze temperatures at or below freezing through the day but a mild weekend is on the way Doppler radar showing some of that snow here moving off into our eastern counties or what\'s left of it here a few lingering flurries back towards the Toledo metro area right now beginning to move in few flurries here towards downtown it\'s this next wave that will continue to move our direction and we\'ll see that here within the next 15 minutes or so maybe already seeing that too close to the 23 475 split there on the northwest corner of the metro area so dealing with some of that light snow trying to move back in but again that temperature at 33 just above freezing it feels like 26 degrees though right now outside with that breeze and that\'s giving us a bit of a wind chill once the snow moves on out it\'ll happen in the next couple of hours we\'ll be left with another cloudy and cold day kind of the trend here as of late 14th day in a row where temperatures been a below average and out of the last 26 days one of them has been sunny that was last week we\'ve got more sunshine in storage just in time for Thanksgiving let\'s track the clouds leaving the area here you can see that by the lunch hour today I will still be dealing with a mostly cloudy sky but the rain and snow any of that precipitation that we\'ve had will be out and a little sunshine trying to get in here at least north and west us 24 by the afternoon later in the afternoon limited sunshine breaks a predictor pretty optimistic for a sunny sky but I think it will be at least some clouds holding on and for tonight the clouds return tomorrow morning it\'ll look cool and gloomy yet again but we\'ll see a little more sunshine in the afternoon Selam chance for a few flurries for a big travel day coming up but really no issues out on the roads by midday by the afternoon going into the evening again a lot of sunshine and a clear sky developing which will set the stage for a bright and sunny Thanksgiving day but it will be cold high temperature of 32 degrees that\'s it morning lows will be in the teens that warm-up had still on track and it is coming it\'ll be here in time for the weekend your border battle forecast and Columbus showing a high of 50 will get there late in the game but rain is expected for tailgating and probably through the first quarter but by the time we get to halftime or so the rain should be moving on out while the South went around 10 miles per hour 34 degrees for today we will continue to see that snow coming to an end and just a little sunshine late this afternoon for tonight 30 for the low it will become breezy so the windchill tomorrow about 18 to 20 or so and if you are traveling tomorrow yeah a few flurries are possible but no travel issues expected around the Great Lakes will be at 36 for the high at seven-day forecast showing 42 for Black Friday 47 on Saturday and Sunday will be at 50 degrees and that\'ll be the extent of that warm-up Monday will likely have rain and wind with a high of 45 after that it gets colder against maybe we should just focus on the seven day forecast if you\'re ready for a warm-up and not ready to talk about the chill returning beyond that one good thing you said talked about putting the turkey outside it would just freeze again could maybe we don\'t want to do that but at least you have extra fridge space all those extra size or something like that all right thanks so

fine but it\'s a bridges and overpasses where you run into that 32 degree temperature where you may run into some slick spots developing this morning temperatures could drop as low as 30 this morning we\'re back to 34 this afternoon with a mostly cloudy sky maybe a flurry tomorrow outside of that we\'re tracking more sunshine but when do we finally warm up we\'ll take a look at the holiday weekend forecast in detail coming up let\'s go over to Heather right now with a look at your can\'t ride a long time saver traffic well as Ross mentioned most of our roadways just wet this morning but of course keep in mind you could see some of those icy conditions so far this morning we\'ve been crashed free but still something to be alert to this morning and taking a live look here I\'m 75 at 475 right here in Toledo the reason you want to give yourself some extra time is because once in a while I\'ve seen drivers taking this ramp here from 475 to northbound i-75 a little bit more slowly which is what you want to plan for here this morning because again on those Burges overpasses and ramps you could see some icy spots right now things are looking pretty good for us that\'s a check your contrada law time-saver traffic former retail property in Toledo has a new owner yep the former Anderson store on Talmadge near Monroe has been sold and that is where we find 13 ABC\'s McKenzie keyline this morning live hey good morning soshim we checked this morning with the lucas county auditor\'s office and they are reporting that the Andersons general store here on Talmadge and Monroe has been sold for 5.2 million dollars they say that the property has been sold to Telmex crossing LLC the company bought the 18 acre property last week and as you might recall the building was built here in 1984 but the inner syns closed their general store and both Toledo and mommy last year due to declining sales according to our media partner the blade the buyer is the CEO of key hotel and property management he tells the blade that he\'s working with three different tenants and plans on turning it into a mixed-use commercial property one of those tenants interested is a medical facility and that also will include a retail section that will face Monroe Street at this point though it\'s not clear if the former Anderson\'s general store here will be demolished of course we\'ll continue to keep you posted on this developing story Jeff and soshim all right thank you very much McKenzie now to that tragedy that unfolded yesterday in the Windy City a police officer an emergency room doctor and a pharmaceutical assistant were all killed when a man opened fire at Chicago\'s Mercy Hospital about three o\'clock yesterday afternoon investigators say the gunman was in a relationship with one of the victims and anther shoot he began in the parking lot when officers got there the gunman opened fire but they fired back there\'s no doubt in my mind and all those officers that responded were heroes and they saved a lot of lives because we just don\'t know how much damage he was prepared to do at this point it\'s unclear if the shooter was killed by police or by a self-inflicted gunshot wound much more on this story coming up on GMA a a crime and safety alert here in our area authorities in Oregon on the lookout for weapons that was stolen from a store in shooting range it happened at the towers armory near Woodville and towers Road police believe a couple of suspects got in through the roof and then left with several firearms now store owners police

sale to someone else the chief tells 13abc he cannot publicly say if any alarms were tripped as they broke in detectives are hopeful surveillance images will get them closer to figuring out who did this three right now and Fremont Police say they are investigating a report of an attempted child abduction there aren\'t a lot of details about this just yet but a witness told investigators that a

dollars on several projects in its council districts however the work ended up coming in under budget by more than 850 thousand dollars so now the Cape\'s cabbage administration wants to give that money that was not spent in each district to that districts councilmember to spend on new projects it\'s not really easy for them under you know the prior way of doing things to request those dollars

waiting for years to get their sidewalk fix and we have not had the money we\'re bringing it back five of the six districts would get this unspent money district two would not receive any because its allotment of funding was used as budgeted now 13abc first warning weather with meteorologist Ross Ellet at a good Tuesday morning a look at those weather headlines we\'ve got the snow from overnight that is ending for this morning and the roads generally look just wet although there may be slick spot or two but the trees and the grass is coated with another layer of some white about a half inch of snow overnight by Thanksgiving we\'re going cold turkey here it\'s gonna be cold by the way if you put the turkey outside to thaw it will thaw it\'ll refreeze temperatures at or below freezing through the day but a mild weekend is on the way Doppler radar showing some of that snow here moving off into our eastern counties or what\'s left of it here a few lingering flurries back towards the Toledo metro area right now beginning to move in few flurries here towards downtown it\'s this next wave that will continue to move our direction and we\'ll see that here within the next 15 minutes or so maybe already seeing that too close to the 23 475 split there on the northwest corner of the metro area so dealing with some of that light snow trying to move back in but again that temperature at 33 just above freezing it feels like 26 degrees though right now outside with that breeze and that\'s giving us a bit of a wind chill once the snow moves on out it\'ll happen in the next couple of hours we\'ll be left with another cloudy and cold day kind of the trend here as of late 14th day in a row where temperatures been a below average and out of the last 26 days one of them has been sunny that was last week we\'ve got more sunshine in storage just in time for Thanksgiving let\'s track the clouds leaving the area here you can see that by the lunch hour today I will still be dealing with a mostly cloudy sky but the rain and snow any of that precipitation that we\'ve had will be out and a little sunshine trying to get in here at least north and west us 24 by the afternoon later in the afternoon limited sunshine breaks a predictor pretty optimistic for a sunny sky but I think it will be at least some clouds holding on and for tonight the clouds return tomorrow morning it\'ll look cool and gloomy yet again but we\'ll see a little more sunshine in the afternoon Selam chance for a few flurries for a big travel day coming up but really no issues out on the roads by midday by the afternoon going into the evening again a lot of sunshine and a clear sky developing which will set the stage for a bright and sunny Thanksgiving day but it will be cold high temperature of 32 degrees that\'s it morning lows will be in the teens that warm-up had still on track and it is coming it\'ll be here in time for the weekend your border battle forecast and Columbus showing a high of 50 will get there late in the game but rain is expected for tailgating and probably through the first quarter but by the time we get to halftime or so the rain should be moving on out while the South went around 10 miles per hour 34 degrees for today we will continue to see that snow coming to an end and just a little sunshine late this afternoon for tonight 30 for the low it will become breezy so the windchill tomorrow about 18 to 20 or so and if you are traveling tomorrow yeah a few flurries are possible but no travel issues expected around the Great Lakes will be at 36 for the high at seven-day forecast showing 42 for Black Friday 47 on Saturday and Sunday will be at 50 degrees and that\'ll be the extent of that warm-up Monday will likely have rain and wind with a high of 45 after that it gets colder against maybe we should just focus on the seven day forecast if you\'re ready for a warm-up and not ready to talk about the chill returning beyond that one good thing you said talked about putting the turkey outside it would just freeze again could maybe we don\'t want to do that but at least you have extra fridge space all those extra size or something like that all right thanks so

Sunday as he has just joined English club Gloucester whom he has yet to play for he should be included when Erasmus completes the squad announcement next week it is good to welcome back a player of

why he took gesturing mark Malian Bella off the pitch chip a United coach Eric Tinkler would only say that he did what I felt was necessary explaining his first half substitution of Captain Mark Malian Bella in Saturday nights won 2-0 Telkom Knockout loss against Orlando Pirates Tinkler said the reason for Malian villas substitution being replaced by Dane clat in the 42nd minute should have been obvious to anyone viewing the game my yam Villa was taken off after the former pirates winger had angrily responded with a wave of his arm at his coach this followed Tinkler having given left-wing Malian Bella a mouthful for being caught out of position on a Buccaneers attack Tinkler was supposed to be the first coach to attend the post-match press conference but took so long with his team in the change rooms after the game that pirates coach mullet and Cerrito czervik ended up going first instead Tinkler later joined in the same press conference where normally at pirates home matches the coaches go separately you didn\'t see why surely it\'s obvious the coach responded when questioned on why he took ma Villa offer but it\'s an internal matter and that will be dealt with internally but it was more than obvious this is the biggest game on TV this weekend everybody across the country is watching pirates and you can\'t behave that way so I reacted to it I did what I felt was necessary but it will be dealt with internally my yam Villa later took to Twitter to apologize for gesturing at his coach my yam Villa substitution came in a first half where Tinkler was not happy with his team\'s performance overall we had planned to press pirates ship as coach said we expected them to play in a 3-4 - 3 or a 3-5-2 formation which they changed but we have played against other teams who have played in a 4-3-3 so the whole plan was to look to press them and we didn\'t do that in the first half both kirtland cheese and Rose ate game old I mean were looking to press onto their centre backs it was too easy for pirates to get the ball to moose in the oedema and then they started coming at us and turning us and creating little spaces in between the lines which was something we practiced and we allowed that to happen in the first half I thought in that first half we looked like we were playing with fear so obviously we had to make changes at halftime and I thought the second half was a vast improvement we made better decisions on the ball and are pressing was a lot better how we conceded the goal was a bit disappointing being beaten at the near post but the way the team reacted was extremely positive we got into the right areas but players have to understand that in those areas you have less time and we wanted too many touches in those areas but overall the second-half performance was good first half not great Pirates took the lead in a period where the teams were matching each other chance for chance when colum Lambo was fed into space on the right and cut back for substitute vincent peale to finish at the near post for blown celtic coach Steve cam fella draws positives from defeat to Sun downs the continuing uncertainty over the sale of bloom Fontaine Celtic has been disruptive and frustrating to the financially distressed side but coach Steve can fella is preferring to focus on things he can control to ensure that the club succeeds on the pitch Celtic crashed out of the Telkom Knockout after an opening round one 2-0 defeat to Maine Lodi Sun downs at Lucas Marin Stadium in at Aerojet Valley west of Pretoria on Saturday and a philosophical compeller said he has told his players to always remember their obligation to the supporters despite the challenges each one of the players understands that we have an obligation to the supporters and good performances like these against a strong team like Maine Lodi Sun downs our points of references we lost the game but I am happy that we are getting better and getting somewhere as a team under the circumstances that the club finds itself in at the moment Campello said it\'s about focus and control and I know that those are big words focus is everything because you have to control emotions and if I can\'t control my thoughts then I will say the wrong things in any situation no matter how dire it is you can\'t be controlled by emotions if I can\'t control my thoughts then I am going to say wrong things hence I say control is everything and that is what we do ask to reflect on the match compelling echoed Sundowns counterpart p somos Amane sentiments that the game was good to watch and value for money for the attending fans who braved the chilly weather apart from the goal and the result I thought it was a nice match to watch he said it was a sensible game of football and both teams by virtue of being possession based were immediately pressing in a game where two teams were playing counter pressing there was going to be a lot of duels I thought we managed that very well and came out of their press zones the only thing we lacked on the night was the goal while cam fellows suspected that the only goal of the match by Gaston Cyrano in the second half may have been offside he said would take the defeat on the chin if proved otherwise I still want to look at it the goal again he said if it was offside we will take in on the chin and move forward when we played Sun downs in bloom contained before the FIFA break there was also a goal scenario that did not help cause I am proud of how the players played and the only thing that we did not do was to score a goal five how blurred lines cost the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup semi-finals even before kick-off the Golden Lions were up against it in the Currie Cup semi-final they lost 33 to 24 to the Sharks in Durban on Saturday SW is de Bruin the Lions Super Rugby coach and boss of all coaching affairs at the franchise made a beeline for this writer and a former Springbok seated in Kings Parks Media Center de Bruin was keen to share the news that the Golden Lions task had become even tougher after grizzled tied head prop jacobi Audrey Anse was ruled out and that young surgeon Phillies would start the match de Bruin sought to lower expectations of his team against the brutish sharks pack but to be fair the Golden Lions were on the back foot long before their leadership has been in a state of flux the season which impacted the office of their president head coach and even the Currie Cup captaincy which changed hence from raw scrawnier to Marvin ory back to Khurana and then Nick grew de Bruin who had accompanied the team to Durban was seated in the press box while his coaching team took up customary position behind glass inside the coach\'s box when substitutions were called de Bruin would turn to his colleagues and with hand gestures encourage the next move the Golden Lions have had to do things in a roundabout way because of de Bruins involvement with the Springboks he could only spend limited time with the Golden Lions and former strength and conditioning coach yvonne van rui and was curiously appointed to the hot seat de Bruin having to pull the strings by a remote control was hardly ideal on the field to decision-making lines were slightly blurred scrum-half nick groom only recently took over as captain but number 8 warren Whiteley\'s restoration to fitness meant that he was always going to play a leadership role in the heat of battle in Durban he was certainly the one mostly engaged in conversation with the referee Marius Vander West realizin whose performance for the record perhaps explains why he has disappeared off world rugby sought after refereeing panel in the build-up to the match it was explained that groom for the purpose of continuity would wear the and in durban as Whiteley\'s availability for the final should the Golden Lions reach it could not be guaranteed widely spread himself around the park especially in defense as the Golden Lions spent much of the match scrambling as predicted to young fillies and you have to feel for him buckled him a scrum while the Golden Lions were bossed in the collisions they did however stage a remarkable comeback after falling 23 to 3 behind after 41 minutes and got themselves to within 2 points before the Sharks sealed the match in defeat van roy yen pointed to the positives it is obviously a massive challenge playing an away semi-final especially in Durban with the wind pumping like that sent to coach obviously it hurts for the union it was a massive step forward during the season we played 11 to 13 under 21 players we finished the game with between 4 and 6 4 of the type 5 we finished with our u21 obviously the result is disappointing but it is a big step ahead it was a great opportunity for us we\'ve got a young pack of forwards the Sharks handled the pressure well in the last 5 to 10 minutes but I\'m very proud of the guys he was particularly pleased the team did not drop their bundle at 23 2 3 down we always stand for good work ethic honesty and character he said we had a moment for a decision to either lay down or stand up and fight obviously I\'m proud of the guys to stand up and fight six blue Bulls coach pote human wants Super Rugby job blue Bulls coach boat human declared his intention to coach the Bulls in Super Rugby but admitted that it was a decision out of his hands humans blue Bulls lost a thrilling curry Cup semi-final 35 to 32 after extra time against Western Province at Newlands on Saturday but quality of their performance suggested human certainly has the players backing captain Han Roly Ben Berg described human as a father figure further suggesting that if it were up to the players human might get the Super Rugby job the Bulls are still searching for a Super Rugby coach after John Mitchell took up a contract with the rugby Paul Union RFU to be England\'s defense coach under Eddie Jones Mitchell had just completed a year of his Bulls contract human assisted Mitchell in a Super Rugby campaign that saw the Bulls struggled but also showed evidence of a new positive playing style that yielded some good results including a win over the Hurricanes humans said that if he was asked to coach Super Rugby he would keep building on what Mitchell started it will be a real honor to coach the Bulls Super Rugby side human said but that is not for me to decide it is a great bunch of players and we love each other they played for me and I worked for them I treated them like my own kids so it would be an awesome experience and privilege to coach the Super Rugby side it depends who gets the Bulls coaching job in Super Rugby but if I am given the opportunity one will definitely carry on with what Mitchell started John really laid a good platform but if a new coach comes in he will probably want to stamp his own ideas on the team at this stage there is a lot of uncertainty around the Super Rugby job human has already looked at areas the Bulls need to improve for Super Rugby identifying depth at prop as an issue after another difficult day scrumming against Western Province the Bulls though were impressive against the high riding Western Province restricting the defending champions to only two tries after a season in which they scored a try bonus point in every pool match it was nearly enough to get them over the line our defense was awesome and our scrums were much better human said I must compliment loose head prop Trevor neocon he showed why he can play both sides of the scrum and he did really well against province tide head will colu our defense was really good today we missed that one line out and they scored but you can\'t put that down to our defensive structures our high lines work perfectly for us today the guys made their tackles and put them under huge pressure seven long road back to Davis Cup Elite for SI after relegation in Portugal South Africa\'s Road to the newly established Davis Cup Finals tournament suffered a major setback when they were relegated from Euro Africa Group one in Portugal at the weekend the four to zero dropping against Portugal in Lisbon sees si dropped to Euro Africa group two in 2019 which means they are unlikely to make it to the new eighteen team finals until 2021 at the earliest and even that is a long way off without top player Kevin Anderson who has not played Davis Cup for six years si were outgunned on the slowed red clay of the CIF club internacional de futbol in the heart of lisbon people will say we were underdogs going into the tie vs Portugal playing away on clay against a team of top 200 ranked players we were always up against it tennis SI chief executive Richard Glover said I disagree these are just excuses we lost both our Davis Cup ties this year one at home and one away and so the brutal truth is that we deserve to be relegated back to group two when we were promoted last year it did not mean everything was suddenly rosy within tennis in South Africa similarly relegation now does not mean all is doom and gloom I will definitely be reviewing how I could have better supported our 2018 Davis Cup campaign I expect everyone in and around the team to do the same on Friday top singles player Lloyd Harris was smashed 6 to 1 6 to 1 by Pedro Sousa in under an hour to put SI immediately on the back foot in the second rubber NIC Schultz started well he broke his higher ranked opponent Joe al Sousa served in the opening game and was 32 0 up serving when so saw came back strong and broke back to level the match at 1 to 1 Sosa proved his class in beating of fighting Schultz 6 to 3 6 to 2 to give Portugal their second win on the opening day having won just seven games in two matches on the opening day doubles specialist Raven Klaasen teamed up with Rouen Roelofs against Joey Sousa and Gaston Elias they battled to keep si in the time they were eventually beaten 6 - 4 6 - 7 4 6 - to the doubles rubber when gave the hosts an unassailable 3 to 0 lead both team captains agreed to play 1 reverse singles rubber following the doubles si captain Marcos Andris can aim debutante Junior Phillip Henning to do duty for his country who went up against Joey Dominguez Dominguez beat Henning six two four six to zero to give Portugal a four to zero clean sweep victory the conditions were tough out there klaussen said the court certainly was prepared well by the Portuguese to suit their games and with the capacity crowd behind them it made it tough today but we had our chances and felt we were playing well enough to win the rubber but Joey and Gaston were just too strong Aundre ska was left stunned it was a tough loss and I am still trying to understand where we went wrong said on drew Scott I felt we played well but Portugal were just too good and played extremely well and used their home tie advantage to full advantage and credit to them for doing that on paper Portugal are the higher ranked team individually and as a team so it was always going to be a tall order to beat them especially away but I did feel we had a chance and that the South Africans played.', 'we are

win over the Hurricanes humans said that if he was asked to coach Super Rugby he would keep building on what Mitchell started it will be a real honor to coach the Bulls Super Rugby side human said but that is not for me to decide it is a great bunch of players and we love each other they played for me and I worked for them I treated them like my own kids so it would be an awesome experience and privilege to coach the Super Rugby side it depends who gets the Bulls coaching job in Super Rugby but if I am given the opportunity one will definitely carry on with what Mitchell started John really laid a good platform but if a new coach comes in he will probably want to stamp his own ideas on the team at this stage there is a lot of uncertainty around the Super Rugby job human has already looked at areas the Bulls need to improve for Super Rugby identifying depth at prop as an issue after another difficult day scrumming against Western Province the Bulls though were impressive against the high riding Western Province restricting the defending champions to only two tries after a season in which they scored a try bonus point in every pool match it was nearly enough to get them over the line our defense was awesome and our scrums were much better human said I must compliment loose head prop Trevor neocon he showed why he can play both sides of the scrum and he did really well against province tide head will colu our defense was really good today we missed that one line out and they scored but you can\'t put that down to our defensive structures our high lines work perfectly for us today the guys made their tackles and put them under huge pressure seven long road back to Davis Cup Elite for SI after relegation in Portugal South Africa\'s Road to the newly established Davis Cup Finals tournament suffered a major setback when they were relegated from Euro Africa Group one in Portugal at the weekend the four to zero dropping against Portugal in Lisbon sees si dropped to Euro Africa group two in 2019 which means they are unlikely to make it to the new eighteen team finals until 2021 at the earliest and even that is a long way off without top player Kevin Anderson who has not played Davis Cup for six years si were outgunned on the slowed red clay of the CIF club internacional de futbol in the heart of lisbon people will say we were underdogs going into the tie vs Portugal playing away on clay against a team of top 200 ranked players we were always up against it tennis SI chief executive Richard Glover said I disagree these are just excuses we lost both our Davis Cup ties this year one at home and one away and so the brutal truth is that we deserve to be relegated back to group two when we were promoted last year it did not mean everything was suddenly rosy within tennis in South Africa similarly relegation now does not mean all is doom and gloom I will definitely be reviewing how I could have better supported our 2018 Davis Cup campaign I expect everyone in and around the team to do the same on Friday top singles player Lloyd Harris was smashed 6 to 1 6 to 1 by Pedro Sousa in under an hour to put SI immediately on the back foot in the second rubber NIC Schultz started well he broke his higher ranked opponent Joe al Sousa served in the opening game and was 32 0 up serving when so saw came back strong and broke back to level the match at 1 to 1 Sosa proved his class in beating of fighting Schultz 6 to 3 6 to 2 to give Portugal their second win on the opening day having won just seven games in two matches on the opening day doubles specialist Raven Klaasen teamed up with Rouen Roelofs against Joey Sousa and Gaston Elias they battled to keep si in the time they were eventually beaten 6 - 4 6 - 7 4 6 - to the doubles rubber when gave the hosts an unassailable 3 to 0 lead both team captains agreed to play 1 reverse singles rubber following the doubles si captain Marcos Andris can aim debutante Junior Phillip Henning to do duty for his country who went up against Joey Dominguez Dominguez beat Henning six two four six to zero to give Portugal a four to zero clean sweep victory the conditions were tough out there klaussen said the court certainly was prepared well by the Portuguese to suit their games and with the capacity crowd behind them it made it tough today but we had our chances and felt we were playing well enough to win the rubber but Joey and Gaston were just too strong Aundre ska was left stunned it was a tough loss and I am still trying to understand where we went wrong said on drew Scott I felt we played well but Portugal were just too good and played extremely well and used their home tie advantage to full advantage and credit to them for doing that on paper Portugal are the higher ranked team individually and as a team so it was always going to be a tall order to beat them especially away but I did feel we had a chance and that the South Africans played.', 'we are

of a sudden out of nowhere is he what do you like on the shoulder you solve the riddle on how a collegiate assistant volleyball coach how Baker Mayfield become the number one naked yes that way poppy what do you rethink the Tom Brady\'s splitting defeat when asked if he feels appreciated Tom Brady who is spent a career purposely saying nothing in front of the cameras has now in the most legal jargon way possible said nothing by pleading the fifth and it means something listen to this do you feel appreciated by them and do they have the appropriate gratitude for what you have achieved I plead the fifth [Laughter] so that\'s it the whole network has been covering this thing before we give you our serious social commentary by two gasbags let\'s get the most honest opinion you can get on this story from anyone this was my father before the show just yammering because he\'s so tired of this story let\'s go what are you reading what do you what\'s the information what you\'ve been a highly I know but what are you gonna unleash where the joke\'s you got for it the question is he\'s no happy he\'s happy maybe he said no he\'s no how happy is he what percentage of happy that\'s right that\'s what the entire network is talking about how happy is Prophecy\'s 94% a thirty-five I might not like Belichick maybe he likes him 94% that\'s right how can you not find this interesting this guy has never done anything like this he never wants to be a distraction he never wants to look like someone who\'s not a team player now he comes out and says he feels under appreciate he\'s been taking discounts forever for the Patriots and I get it I get why Tom Brady would think he\'s responsible for his own success and that he would not like it very much that the Patriots think that they\'re responsible for taking a six round pick and making him into what they would have made Jimmy Garoppolo into because the Patriots way is the way that matters I hope this one\'s stung for you a little bit laboratory because I feel like this was Tom Brady essentially saying hey those debates that you hate about who\'s more important to the Patriots Tom Brady or Bill Belichick they actually happened and that Tom Brady is one of those people that says man I don\'t get enough credit I should get more credit for being a five-time Super Bowl champ in this organization but what I found really interesting about is just that that little peek into Tom Brady a little peek into that personal portion that hey he does feel offended that he\'s not getting enough credit that hey he does have an opinion on the Neely situation on the protest he\'s just not quite ready to throw it out there and ruin Team PR I think overall what I hope really ends up being this sort of fight between Belichick and Brady is is Brady being more of the latest late career Kobe Bryant that just being honest and being open I\'m not caring about what Bill Belichick and the Patriots are gonna do I\'m hoping okay we\'re all hoping for that but pleading the fifth on something is not exactly Kobe not giving any bleeps the most we\'ve ever heard from him I don\'t know what he\'s complaining about it he makes a lot of money he makes half of what Jimmy got up alone that might be the source of all of this by the way just that where you got backs to quaked 190 70 sixes that\'s gas bag this is a gas bag he\'s the guy who calls others gas bags while being filled with more gas than anyone in the history of petroleum what we have happening here though is a situation where the Sixers have to suffer some you do not get in that sport from being someone who\'s never in the playoffs to someone who just rolls through the playoffs there are some things that happened last night that aren\'t going to happen again Ben Simmons was terrible more turnovers than assists Boston made everything you got Rozier and the Horford you got these guys Tatum scoring more together than Garnett Pierce and Allen ever did in a game that\'s probably not gonna happen again so why is this a Sixers thing why isn\'t it a Celtics thing why isn\'t it a Brad Stevens thing because a name that you didn\'t mention was jaylen Brown who wasn\'t even in the game because he was hurt and they still had this type of performance I got from those three guys shot 63% and frankly I think we are all Eric Bledsoe now because nobody knew who Terry Rozier was and nobody knew he could do this specifically in the playoffs against the team that we thought was going to make the finals agreed none of us knew who scary Terry was but I\'ll tell you who he was in the previous incarnation Isiah Thomas when he got the usage rate on that team with players that weren\'t as good as the young players this team has now it is crazy that Boston has three starters out and one that way last night but none of you want them to advance because you know that team is too broken to do anything meaningful after this this is not the team anyone wants to know maybe it\'s a Brad Stevens thing I mean look he figured out how to get these guys to shoot poorly from three and to somehow get the word from Ben Simmons and win despite Joe LMB doing his thing in the post there\'s a reason Brad Stevens is taking this team where he is valor seeks is a gun shoot threes what happened in the so true he\'s like what happened so wait Ilyas over Belinelli aren\'t actually that good do either of you two have the intestinal fortitude to beat the Raptors over the Liberals to line the intestinal fortitude is something that I do not have because Toronto Raptors I do not trust them I know that they\'ve got a coach of the year I know they\'re playing differently I know that their bench is stronger than it has been but I cannot bring myself to pick against LeBron in a series when you know that he\'s always going to be the best player on the court and you\'re just watching him come off even though he\'s on a weak team the single best postseason performance that we\'ve seen over seven games from him that\'s a crazy high bar for him to climb over the Raptors they don\'t seem to be the team that anyone believes can do it man I used to be that person too and a couple weeks ago I was that person that said the Raptors might even lose in the first round to the Wizards my money\'s on the Cavs and then I watched the Cavs Pacers for seven games and man it requires again requires LeBron to do that much for that team to get out of that round I don\'t believe the Raptors are worse than the Pacers I think they are better than the Pacers I think obviously going into this series in Toronto is not great for the Cleveland Cavaliers their only strength here is really the confidence that they\'ve built up over those last two games against the Toronto Raptors they happen to be in Cleveland as well I don\'t know if this is the team that can beat the Raptors this might be the Raptors team that overcomes them everybody talks about DeMar DeRozan they talk about Kyle Lowry they talk about the other guy was the other guy Mel insurance serge ibaka sorry about sochi baguette but the guy said nobody talks about it they\'re going to make the difference going to be CRM and I don\'t be that\'s for the two guys are going to be that way they\'re going to be in the wrong body and I\'m telling you the Bronx topper topper that\'s it that\'s going to be the attractor in that\'s two guys opportunity all right LeBron Stoppers keep in mind my father also called Lance Stephenson LeBron worst nightmare before LeBron went off for 45 the other day in Game seven and Lance was in foul trouble that\'s the way goes that way sometimes ha shoo Browns fans feel about the team\'s explanation for passing on just rushing this was sort of amazing alonzo highsmith best athlete in the history of University of Miami football by consensus has come as a scout to come to a high place in the Browns organization he says he was at an airport and he was around the volleyball team for UCLA and he asked an assistant coach about Josh Rosen and the response was go ask his girlfriend and alonzo highsmith knew on the spot I don\'t like this guy he smells fishy I\'m not gonna draft him that\'s the way that you do the drafting in Cleveland if you are used to two decades of unfathomable failure it seems like great honesty that he would say that it doesn\'t exactly seem like advanced analytics it seems like a job anybody can do anybody at this table can do and further he talks about Baker Mayfield and how he commanded a room when he walked in man the Browns are just gonna be the Browns even if they land on both of these guys Ward and Mayfield with the number one and number four pick they\'re not doing it right going in there saying all the wrong things and it doesn\'t really give you confidence that they made the right choice based on football matters it\'s kind of embarrassing if I\'m a Browns fan you know should be mad that the volleyball coach who\'s that Baker may film that he has to leave in Cleveland want to go UCLA volleyball coach he gets to go back to California live in the shadows of Johnny Manziel you can also say well you know they\'re making progress it went from a homeless guy body boat coach all you know that is you could also say that that\'s correct that would be another joke he could have used dominum Knicks are highly questionable you know I just decided to fight back and I\'ve been doing it ever since so once I guess I had enough of my food and take it from what nothing that if I\'ll make it I\'m going to eat it and if you have problem with you gonna have to come see these to know like in Mike joining us at the beach today just not man made his debut Dancing with the Stars last night one of the best quarterbacks in the league you could see the look on Izzy\'s face for some reason Josh Norman hates is he good ierra so we\'re getting him out of here let\'s talk to Josh Norman what was the furthest you were away from the dream because I remember you telling me one time weren\'t you running and running sprints outside a car wash or something that you were training in play in strange places trying to get to the league what\'s the furthest you were away from the league when people were doubting you and you didn\'t think he\'d make it I think first coming in mama whoa what anything out we\'re gonna make it was at the high school when I didn\'t have a college to go to bring my cell out my whole year with my brother I went up there to coach Carolina Myrtle Beach and you know I was at the mental health technician I was one of those I got a job there at a lighthouse and I found myself outside you know training myself running through the parking lots and pretty much the whole complex timing myself and trying to get better in that aspect and knowing that this is the hard part for me this is my stepping point to wherever I go I always remember this because this was the defining moment of my life if I get past this I can get through anything when your brothers were helping you supporting you in more ways than one what do you remember about that time what do you remember specifically about the ways your brothers helped you well it was always come up and support me and Coastal Carolina and I\'m other brother and us in the games you know I remember them having speeches Chino he would have a speech for every game you know and we\'ll get excited to get crunk for the game I always had those speeches and motivational \'s get you ready to go out there and run through a brick wall as he would say you\'re a linebacker let\'s go and he loved Ray Lewis so he got that from him and he would try to steal that mindset in us before we caught down the field and and kind of things of that sort of nature and but we always been together I\'ve been tight and close you know growing up we\'ll fight a lot and then there\'s we got older kind of like diminished but we still with tussle with each other so like I want to hear about that though I want to hear about the fights and the tussles what\'s the memorable one what\'s the most famous one in the family give me the best one the one so everyone still talks about cuz you were the little guy right you were taking the beatings weren\'t you yeah I was until one day you know I just decided to fight back and I\'ve been doing it ever since so once I guess I had enough of my food and take it from well enough of that if I\'ll make it I\'m going to eat it and if you have problem with you\'re gonna have to come see these two Naugles Ike and Mike and I\'m telling you right now they\'re gonna be fierce and I\'m gonna keep going until you quit me hang on Mike I can micro the fish you\'re gonna have to see I can Mike if you steal my food you were cooking the food and your brothers were just stealing it I mean they wait I will cook it and they\'ll kind of like Bogart it in a way they were coming in there it\'s just like okay you could be fool you have no is in there for you but isn\'t there for us to kind of thing it was in the kitchen so that means everybody can have some but you didn\'t put work into this yeah we all had that problem for a little while and then you know someone older would come in and step into the pot and be like all right well you know this is yours and this is his kind of thing yeah oh just like you know I had enough of it I\'m cooking and your face and I mean eating your face you got a prob where we going tussle what you want to do and they would like get on me because I would calm I\'m out of time and she was at work and she would tell them what do and they\'ll do it so that was kind of my way of my out and yeah why see wait a minute so but you\'re making it sound like you were a bad man and we\'re gonna have to tussle but all you did was call your mother like I don\'t know I mean you just hold your brothers is all you did like you didn\'t do anything well shoot when I like three years four years old in you and then they had a whole like I know with the way we resent it and then I went in there one day and I can\'t lose and they were stealing and I beat him up that\'s not what happened all you just call mom Bess was in their earlier stages like the young like the you know the eighth the ninth of ten stages when I got to be living 12 like I had enough of it you know I\'m saying it was just like all right we\'re gonna battle until one of us just fall out like that was gonna happen so I mean we\'re not talking about the early stages dealt with then and then I got enough for doing that and just decided that you know that wasn\'t the way I was gonna go out if I was gonna go out at least I was gonna have some type of blood or or something on me so I can actually say I got him - very good I mean guys she was gonna be some type of me at each other but in a day that\'s that\'s what siblings do maybe was just a little bit more aggressive than other people but that\'s the message you had to have but we was always good and respectful with people and elders and what we did so it when I got out of hand too bad Josh probably wants a crack at you go ahead poppy what do you got yes gotten you gage a seat the limb drop me one of his sons thank you all right that\'s my father one man use a window shopper mad at me I think I know why man use a window shopper in the store looking at stuff you can buy man use a window shopper in the dealership trying to get a test-drive man use a window shopper mad at me when you see me right by [Music] time to play the game that is a fashion icon do you question you give us topics and events and we question them do you question they catch your safewords the catchers effort this is what we do around here we study journalism we get Disney to pay us we go to college softball Texas in Oklahoma and we determine whether the catcher is making an effort celebrate number 15 for being okay that was a great move arguably the greatest slide I\'ve seen today it\'s a great slide I\'ve seen today oh man that kitchen made a big mistakes when something let that happen you gotta cover that play you got a seat from that place did you sit on that plane you pointed that place there\'s no way that runner can touch that plate that\'s it that\'s that\'s that\'s a cardinal sin baseball football whatever you want to go to we know that\'s illegal in softball we have no idea if it it should be but it\'s great it\'s great advice do your question if this kid has a future in baseball we cover I\'m young around here we go out to Little League we got a bases loaded situation parts unknown the runner on third is being walked in there\'s a base on ball man this is the littlest of Little League oh he\'s a showboat they\'re gonna throw so many baseballs at him in the future maybe his next at-bat that kid is getting something these are the rules of baseball you showboat kid more than anything I love it as coaches letting him do it it\'s called a block it\'s not called the job off me conquer off me yeah disciplines I\'m in mid performing I\'ve been working my whole life for this for entire years for this moment yes this is amazing yes the commitment one pick in the 2013 draft thank you would that have been a run if a softball catcher had been sitting on home plate would it have town it time to play the game that always halt a crush see Oh No you tell us what to watch on television tonight why are we holding grudges on TNT game to pelicans and warriors Steve Kerr and Alvin Gentry they used to work on the same bench together I am told that there is sound of them talking to each other I\'m hoping it\'s if they\'re giggling about Luke Walton and the job he\'s doing with the Lakers let\'s see what we\'ve got here we got to do this thing for the camera so that we can say all right that\'s good the most honest wired for sound you\'ve ever gotten he\'s saying the whole thing\'s a sham we\'re paying for the rights to broadcast that easier you and true I\'m super intrigued just by this series but also I guarantee you down the road there is a of unused wired for sound yes because we\'re not allowed to use the good stuff yes we only use that good someone needs to leak the good stuff we\'d all watch that show popular you and tree OCC every tree you know everybody\'s very excited about Steph Curry coming back but they don\'t need him at all that\'s true they got three guys that are there the keys that didn\'t just keep Steph current bank you know they got traction they got me and they got Tyrell McGee the three musketeers gonna make it happen nobody you know I mean he\'s trying to get this floundering communicator off the ground where he just does the JaVale swaggy P Pachulia jokes and it\'s not working it\'s gonna sink all of us on NBC Sports Bay Area Padres and Giants no thank you but papi what do you know about Pablo sound of all what do you know about him Palo Santo wah all men he he used to play third base for the Giants noise and oddly enough he still plays but he\'s still over there except the other day they were down 15 to 6 so the third baseman was put on the mound let\'s see is he Rollie pollie what happened here Oh 84 right to the second baseman are we gonna sure what are we gonna get how many outs are we gonna get here oh seven horner oh look at this easy making it look easy Oh big breaking stuff look at that you cannot hit the ball to the outfield against mighty Pablo Sandoval\'s yeah that\'s very exciting had no idea he was still in the league is your you and tree I am NOT intrigued however it is curious I wonder if he picked the wrong position because at third-base that body type gets mocked as a pitcher it doesn\'t it could\'ve totally ate a career as a pitcher no he couldn\'t have poppy are you intrigued balls easy everybody tell you one thing I know who he\'s trying to compete against he shreds by telling you if I can do it I can do it better you know it\'s

attractor in that\'s two guys opportunity all right LeBron Stoppers keep in mind my father also called Lance Stephenson LeBron worst nightmare before LeBron went off for 45 the other day in Game seven and Lance was in foul trouble that\'s the way goes that way sometimes ha shoo Browns fans feel about the team\'s explanation for passing on just rushing this was sort of amazing alonzo highsmith best athlete in the history of University of Miami football by consensus has come as a scout to come to a high place in the Browns organization he says he was at an airport and he was around the volleyball team for UCLA and he asked an assistant coach about Josh Rosen and the response was go ask his girlfriend and alonzo highsmith knew on the spot I don\'t like this guy he smells fishy I\'m not gonna draft him that\'s the way that you do the drafting in Cleveland if you are used to two decades of unfathomable failure it seems like great honesty that he would say that it doesn\'t exactly seem like advanced analytics it seems like a job anybody can do anybody at this table can do and further he talks about Baker Mayfield and how he commanded a room when he walked in man the Browns are just gonna be the Browns even if they land on both of these guys Ward and Mayfield with the number one and number four pick they\'re not doing it right going in there saying all the wrong things and it doesn\'t really give you confidence that they made the right choice based on football matters it\'s kind of embarrassing if I\'m a Browns fan you know should be mad that the volleyball coach who\'s that Baker may film that he has to leave in Cleveland want to go UCLA volleyball coach he gets to go back to California live in the shadows of Johnny Manziel you can also say well you know they\'re making progress it went from a homeless guy body boat coach all you know that is you could also say that that\'s correct that would be another joke he could have used dominum Knicks are highly questionable

times more trash than a regular can big belly solar trash cans collect waste and recycling items these trash cans are designed the Loom is a daily need of collection truck when it is packed the bin sends a text message to Phoenix Public Works the cool thing about these bins is they actually tell us when they\'re full so we get live data that says hey your bins full come pick it up the goal is to reduce the number of trash pickups from three times to once a week these solar trash cans save time money and the possibility of lives any sort of public safety concerns we can lock these units down

about fabric from unwanted clothes filling our landfills now a fashion incubator is bringing sustainable manufacturing to Tempe the fashion industry is literally the second most polluting industry on the planet next to the oil industry Angela Johnson the co-founder of the fabric building in Tempe is trying to change that she built a place for local designers to produce their clothing she says locally made fashion is more unique of higher quality and is produced in smaller quantities so there is less waste people think their clothing is disposable because they only spent $10 for it then they can throw it out in a couple weeks when they\'re not wearing it anymore and they fill up the landfills like crazy according to the Council for textile recycling the average person throws away 70 pounds of textiles each year many designers with fabric believe produced in clothing locally can also help reduce waste and pollution sharain Dora local designer manufactures her bug repellant clothing line at the Tempe warehouse I really felt pulled to manufacturing domestically because - seemed like the right thing to do Sheri berry the co-founder has more eco-friendly plans for the company\'s future use textiles that are organically grown and made with organic dyes so that there\'s they\'re not toxic and they don\'t pollute the environment Johnson believes that with a more educated consumer based fashion incubators like hers will be the wave of the future making fashion a more sustainable industry all the resources in the fabric building are open to the public and free

that money might be spent 40 percent of daily freeway traffic in Maricopa County is on Interstate 17 and interstate 10 corridor for more Phoenix all the way to the southeast Valley it\'s nicknamed the spine and the Maricopa Association of Governments wants your input to decide how to reduce traffic on those freeways no matter how early you leave work or home still end up in bumper-to-bumper traffic on your daily commute on the i-10 and i-17 corridor that frustration is why leaders of the Maricopa Association of Governments proposing a one point four billion dollars in solutions I take the bus because it\'s extremely too much traffic and a lot of accidents people aren\'t focused on the freeway this corridor is named the spine because it serves as the backbone for transportation and the Phoenix metropolitan area key parts of the corridor improvement plan include adding HOV lanes adding pedestrian and bicycle crossings at 20 locations and bring for light rail stations along the freeway transportation officials will also add 24 freeway entrance signals that use lanes instead of stop and go traffic lights this is really the future of the city and how we get people from point A to point B to work to school to play to church to the grocery store that\'s what really affects people\'s day-to-day life the public is encouraged to give their thoughts on the plan to improve the corridor anything that we can do to help improve the commute and again bring back some reliability to the system that would be great that would be great I mean I would be able to come to work and get here a lot faster as well the outcome of the spine study will be a detailed strategy to improve traffic flows along the i-10 and i-17 corridors through 2040 if you would like more information related to the i-10 i-17 or to give your opinion on the spine Quarter master plan go to spine a zmax gov Morgan wheeler Cronkite news Tucson has been recognized worldwide as a city of gastronomy and now some

modified food Sandra Oh Macey is one of them I\'ve my mother started being green decades ago and she instilled in us the importance of sustainable eating organic and even though I don\'t make a lot of money hardly any I still spend what little I have on organic because it\'s so important Monsanto says GMO production makes farming more efficient by producing more seeds and conserving water the company also says it\'s safe GMOs have been approved for cultivation which means the ability to grow GMO seeds in the soil in over 70 countries increasing the food supply is important for growing global population we live longer No maybe not healthier but longer and we have also countries that have developed their economies and now a lot of people in those countries have larger income

Sumiko is finding out how aquaponics is breaking into the mainstream John Healy averages over 15,000 workers at his business in Glendale Arizona however most of them don\'t even know they\'re working the fish creative waste into the nitrogen cycle if you remember your high school biology that waste is converted into nitrogen and the nitrogen fertilizes the plants plants remove the nitrogen from the water and give fish back the clean water after discovering aquaponics seven years ago TV started his own business helping others and to the world of farming with fish aquaponics actually uses no dirt at all instead using a small rock like medium that requires no composting no rototilling no fertilizer and no pesticides now while aquaponics has more water and space efficient it isn\'t designed to replace hundred acre farms it\'s designed to supplement them and give food sources closer to urban communities dr. George Brooks jr. who started his own agricultural technology consulting firm believes aquaponics is about to be commonplace in the valley the city of seniors wrote in their general plan that they want to have urban farming what we need are high-tech methods that are low cost and highly efficient that will allow us to allow this to happen and aquaponics in my opinion will be one of those methodologies to make this new green this new green revolution work for people interested in growing plants using aquaponics dr. Brooks teaches a class at Mesa Community College aquaponics material suppliers have their own classes and there\'s even free online books about the topic this is a way of the future as for Healy he recommends the new aquaponics grower start small grow big and don\'t over engineer it in Glendale Judge Michael Cronkite news state water leaders are moving ahead to allow recycled water from your toilet and shower to flow from your water faucet reporter Morgan wheeler explains why this is needed drinking treated wastewater is currently prohibited with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality says technology has improved enough to deliver clean recycled water to your faucet but the challenge is to overcome raspberry\'s about taste and safety a fear of is it safe is it is it healthy what about pollutants the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality is working to change the prohibition of putting treated wastewater directly back into a city\'s water supply experts say drought and low water supplies in smaller communities are reasons that should change you may be potentially some Mountain communities that are very dependent on unlimited water sources limited surface water sources or limited groundwater sources might be the first ones that are that are interested in that reclaim drinking water isn\'t new Singapore and California both use it uh northern Arizona vineyard uses reclaimed water to grow grapes for wine and thinks drinking recycled water is a natural next step it\'s the future for Arizona to be using every drop of water Hollander that\'s our that\'s our mission to educate inform the public that it can be done and it\'s done everywhere just hasn\'t done here yet the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality is working on a draft of rules that we\'ll be taking to the governor\'s regulator Review Council to get approved chad graph says this water is being tested and should be concluded by the end of this year in the broadcast Center Morgan wheeler Cronkite news high school students from across the state spoke out about environmental changes they hope to see from the state legislature Cronkite news reporter Ashley Holcomb gives us a look to how students took part in today\'s environmental day at the Capitol 60 students from all over the state gathered at the Arizona State Capitol for environmental day the theme this year protecting the Arizona we all share water conservation and preserving Arizona state parks were just a few of the environmental issues discussed high school student Anna Rose Moore Almeida shared her concerns about air pollution its likes me it affects my friends it affects my family and it just it\'s one of the things that I\'ve always fought for since I started sandy Bahr of the Arizona Sierra Club believes it is important for these students to speak out and let lawmakers know what changes they want to see in Environmental Policy to me when when we don\'t care for the environment when we don\'t address climate change that is that\'s not fair to future generations and so I think their voices really need to be heard here at the legislature because it\'s about their future the students are hopeful that the more they voice their concerns the more changes will be made in Phoenix Ashley Holcomb Cronkite news ASU is one of many universities paving the way in finding new solutions to providing natural energy-efficient resources to students on campus as well as maintaining a clean environment Cronkite news reporter Chantal de la joya takes us to UCLA where sustainable technology is giving students the opportunity to spend more productive time outdoors honestly I didn\'t even know that we had them but I think it\'s a great idea she\'s talking about new solar-powered umbrellas which are making it convenient for students to study outside without wearing their mobile devices are about to die we figured not only was it a great way to make sustainable technology visible for students but it\'s also a really great way to encourage students to spend more time outdoors with funding from the University of California\'s green initiative fund Sophie and her group were able to install five umbrellas popular kerckhoffs patio there\'s between three and ten dollars taken out of every single students tuition and that goes into the green initiative fund and then students across campus can apply to receive funding from from the green initiative fund for different sustainable and conservation projects on campus the umbrellas can hold a charge for up to eight hours without sunlight which is great for students to be able to study outdoors I think they\'re really useful it was nice to come out here and still be able to charge my phone also students in shades before we didn\'t used to have these it would be like burning Sun and while these students will graduate and move on University staff predict we\'ll be around to see more of these projects in years ahead I mean I think it\'s very satisfying you need power you device the sun\'s right there cut all the middle middle people out and you just power your device directly and at $2,500 per umbrella these solar advocates say it\'s money well spent in Los Angeles Chantal del Aguila Cronkite news ASU currently has installed ten ngr solar panel devices across all campuses the collaborations with light works has been providing energy efficient solutions for faculty staff and students the City of Phoenix is currently recycling approximately 17,000 pounds a year of glass not all blasts gets recycled reporter Nicole Gutierrez tells us how one company bases its business on old bottles according to the EPA people in the u.s. generated more than 11 million tons of class and 2014 alone and only one-fourth of that glass is recycled but a valley company is rescuing wine bottles to do its part in recycling process this was a perfectly good wine bottle now it\'s on its way to a new life is an example of a glass that might be made from a bottle like this Fredo Amaro is owner of refreshed glass he refreshes old wine bottles into cocktail and water glasses his business has processed more than 1 million bottles in eight years this is a craft we have the ability to do printing and custom engraving as well and then we also make planters some people use these as as shot glasses so we have a fairly wide variety of different functional uses that we can make out of a single wine bottle Meghan circles whether using cups we know the recycled wine bottles is both functional and durable for their restaurants working bars my whole life and on average I\'d say probably a dozen glasses get broke in a week and I probably on the lighter ends whereas these maybe a dozen every couple months McGregor also has classes made specifically for his bar so I like the fact that they\'re all different sides of a slightly different color or something a little bit different about it so these are all the tops of the wine bottles as you can tell so I made these surfboards in my garage and these are a whiskey flight so now if you don\'t want to get just you know one file of whiskey you can take four different kinds and get a sample of all four whiskey\'s according to keep Phoenix beautiful you can do your parts and recycles last by making sure bottles and jars as well as food grade glass containers make it to the recycling bin in the first place remember window panes mirrors light bulbs and treated glass like the ones you find in your car should be disposed elsewhere and the broadcast liner Nicole Kyra\'s

regulated we can use you know whatever we want and but you know us being responsible we like to use as little as possible through flood irrigation this carrot field here would be flooded for hours with gallons of water starting from this end and ending with that end but the problem is those plants where we started will be in water for hours and these plants are dry but drip irrigation can fix that we\'re somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent efficient with flood where as drip can get in the 90% range efficient converting to drip cost a thousand dollars per acre a price that some farmers are not able to pay according to Kim Sonic from the Nature Conservancy you have to install a pump you have to have filtered water you have a power cost associated with the farmer takes on and you have a lot of upfront labor to get that equipment in the ground the nature conservancy funds projects throughout the Verde Valley with the help of changed the course a nationwide campaign to restore fresh water change the course purchase companies like REI and coca-cola to offset their water usage by funding projects and build a concentrate see the actual impact in an area that is iconic beautiful a great place to paddle and connected to the health of the watershed now that the project is paid for it\'s up to the Hauser\'s to make it work trying to carry on you know tradition not mess

the fish creative waste into the nitrogen cycle if you remember your high school biology that waste is converted into nitrogen and the nitrogen fertilizes the plants plants remove the nitrogen from the water and give fish back the clean water after discovering aquaponics seven years ago TV started his own business helping others and to the world of farming with fish aquaponics actually uses no dirt at all instead using a small rock like medium that requires no composting no rototilling no fertilizer and no pesticides now while aquaponics has more water and space efficient it isn\'t designed to replace hundred acre farms it\'s designed to supplement them and give food sources closer to urban communities dr. George Brooks jr. who started his own agricultural technology consulting firm believes aquaponics is about to be commonplace in the valley the city of seniors wrote in their general plan that they want to have urban farming what we need are high-tech methods that are low cost and highly efficient that will allow us to allow this to happen and aquaponics in my opinion will be one of those methodologies to make this new green this new green revolution work for people interested in growing plants using aquaponics dr. Brooks teaches a class at Mesa Community College aquaponics material suppliers have their own classes and there\'s even free online books about the topic this is a way of the future as for Healy he recommends the new aquaponics grower start small grow big and don\'t over engineer it in Glendale Judge Michael Cronkite news state water leaders are moving ahead to allow recycled water from your toilet and shower to flow from your water faucet reporter Morgan wheeler explains why this is needed drinking treated wastewater is currently prohibited with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality says technology has improved enough to deliver clean recycled water to your faucet but the challenge is to overcome raspberry\'s about taste and safety a fear of is it safe is it is it healthy what about pollutants the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality is working to change the prohibition of putting treated wastewater directly back into a city\'s water supply experts say drought and low water supplies in smaller communities are reasons that should change you may be potentially some Mountain communities that are very dependent on unlimited water sources limited surface water sources or limited groundwater sources might be the first ones that are that are interested in that reclaim drinking water isn\'t new Singapore and California both use it uh northern Arizona vineyard uses reclaimed water to grow grapes for wine and thinks drinking recycled water is a natural next step it\'s the future for Arizona to be using every drop of water Hollander that\'s our that\'s our mission to educate inform the public that it can be done and it\'s done everywhere just hasn\'t done here yet the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality is working on a draft of rules that we\'ll

Cronkite news high school students from across the state spoke out about environmental changes they hope to see from the state legislature Cronkite news reporter Ashley Holcomb gives us a look to how students took part in today\'s environmental day at the Capitol 60 students from all over the state gathered at the Arizona State Capitol for environmental day the theme this year protecting the Arizona we all share water conservation and preserving Arizona state parks were just a few of the environmental issues discussed high school student Anna Rose Moore Almeida shared her concerns about air pollution its likes me it affects my friends it affects my family and it just it\'s one of the things that I\'ve always fought for since I started sandy Bahr of the Arizona Sierra Club believes it is important for these students to speak out and let lawmakers know what changes they want to see in Environmental Policy to me when when we don\'t care for the environment when we don\'t address climate change that is that\'s not fair to future generations and so I think their voices really need to be heard here at the legislature because it\'s about their future the students are hopeful that the more they voice their concerns the more changes will be made in Phoenix Ashley Holcomb Cronkite news ASU is one of many universities paving the way in finding new solutions to providing natural energy-efficient resources to students on campus as well as maintaining a clean environment Cronkite news reporter Chantal de la joya takes us to UCLA where sustainable technology is giving students the opportunity to spend more productive time outdoors honestly I didn\'t even know that we had them but I think it\'s a great idea she\'s talking about new solar-powered umbrellas which are making it convenient for students to study outside without wearing their mobile devices are about to die we figured not only was it a great way to make sustainable technology visible for students but it\'s also a really great way to encourage students to spend more time outdoors with funding from the University of California\'s green initiative fund Sophie and her group were able to install five umbrellas popular kerckhoffs patio there\'s between three and ten dollars taken out of every single students tuition and that goes into the green initiative fund and then students across campus can apply to receive funding from from the green initiative fund for different sustainable and conservation projects on campus the umbrellas can hold a charge for up to eight hours without sunlight which is great for students to be able to study outdoors I think they\'re really useful it was nice to come out here and still be able to charge my phone also students in shades before we didn\'t used to have these it would be like burning Sun and while these students will graduate and move on University staff predict we\'ll be around to see more of these projects in years ahead I mean I think it\'s very satisfying you need power you device the sun\'s right there cut all the middle middle people out and you just power your device directly and at $2,500 per umbrella these solar advocates say it\'s money well spent in Los Angeles Chantal del Aguila Cronkite news ASU currently has installed ten ngr solar panel devices across all campuses the collaborations with light works has been providing energy efficient solutions for faculty staff and students the City of Phoenix is currently recycling approximately 17,000 pounds a year of glass not all blasts gets recycled reporter Nicole Gutierrez tells us how one company bases its business on old bottles according to the EPA people in the u.s. generated more than 11 million tons of class and 2014 alone and only one-fourth of that glass is recycled but a valley company is rescuing wine bottles to do its part in recycling process this was a perfectly good wine bottle now it\'s on its way to a new life is an example of a glass that might be made from a bottle like this Fredo Amaro is owner of refreshed glass he refreshes old wine bottles into cocktail and water glasses his business has processed more than 1 million bottles in eight years this is a craft we have the ability to do printing and custom engraving as well and then we also make planters some people use these as as shot glasses so we have a fairly wide variety of different functional uses that we can make out of a single wine bottle Meghan circles whether using cups we know the recycled wine bottles is both functional and durable for their restaurants working bars my whole life and on average I\'d say probably a dozen glasses get broke in a week and I probably on the lighter ends whereas these maybe a dozen every couple months McGregor also has classes made specifically for his bar so I like the fact that they\'re all different sides of a slightly different color or something a little bit different about it so these are all the tops of the wine bottles as you can tell so I made these surfboards in my garage and these are a whiskey flight so now if you don\'t want to get just you know one file of whiskey you can take four different kinds and get a sample of all four whiskey\'s according to keep Phoenix beautiful you can do your parts and recycles last by making sure bottles and jars as well as food grade glass containers make it to the recycling bin in the first place remember window panes mirrors light bulbs and treated glass like the ones you find in your car should be disposed elsewhere and the broadcast liner Nicole Kyra\'s Cronkite news water in the Verde River is under a lot of stress from farmers in the Verde Valley I spent the day with one farmer looking to conserve with the help of a group that has restored over 2

with gallons of water starting from this end and ending with that end but the problem is those plants where we started will be in water for hours and these plants are dry but drip irrigation can fix that we\'re somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent efficient with flood where as drip can get in the 90% range efficient converting to drip cost a thousand dollars per acre a price that some farmers are not able to pay according to Kim Sonic from the Nature Conservancy you have to install a pump you have to have filtered water you have a power cost associated with the farmer takes on and you have a lot of upfront labor to get that equipment in the ground the nature conservancy funds projects throughout the Verde Valley with the help of changed the course a nationwide campaign to restore fresh water change the course purchase companies like REI and coca-cola to offset their water usage by funding projects and build a concentrate see the actual impact in an area that is iconic beautiful a great place to paddle and connected to the health of the watershed now that the project is paid for it\'s up to the Hauser\'s to make it work trying to carry on you know tradition not mess

the water and give fish back the clean water after discovering aquaponics seven years ago TV started his own business helping others and to the world of farming with fish aquaponics actually uses no dirt at all instead using a small rock like medium that requires no composting no rototilling no fertilizer and no pesticides now while aquaponics has more water and space efficient it isn\'t designed to replace hundred acre farms it\'s designed to supplement them and give food sources closer to urban communities dr. George Brooks jr. who started his own agricultural technology consulting firm believes aquaponics is about to be commonplace in the valley the city of seniors wrote in their general plan that they want to have urban farming what we need are high-tech methods that are low cost and highly efficient that will allow us to allow this to happen and aquaponics in my opinion will be one of those methodologies to make this new green this new green revolution work for people interested in growing plants using aquaponics dr. Brooks teaches a class at Mesa Community College aquaponics material suppliers have their own classes and there\'s even free online books about the topic this is a way of the future as for Healy he recommends the new aquaponics grower start small grow big and don\'t over engineer it in Glendale Judge Michael Cronkite news state water leaders are moving ahead to allow recycled water from your toilet and shower to flow from your water faucet reporter Morgan wheeler explains why this is needed drinking treated wastewater is currently prohibited with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality says technology has improved enough to deliver clean recycled water to your faucet but the challenge is to overcome raspberry\'s about taste and safety a fear of is it safe is it is it healthy what about pollutants the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality is working to change the prohibition of putting treated wastewater directly back into a city\'s water supply experts say drought and low water supplies in smaller communities are reasons that should change you may be potentially some Mountain communities that are very dependent on unlimited water sources limited surface water sources or limited groundwater sources might be the first ones that are that are interested in that reclaim drinking water isn\'t new Singapore and California both use it uh northern Arizona vineyard uses reclaimed water to grow grapes for wine and thinks drinking recycled water is a natural next step it\'s the future for Arizona to be using every drop of water Hollander that\'s our that\'s our mission to educate inform the public that it can be done and it\'s done everywhere just hasn\'t done here yet the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality is working on a draft of rules that we\'ll be taking to the governor\'s regulator Review Council to get approved chad graph says this water is being tested and should be concluded by the end of this year in the broadcast Center Morgan wheeler Cronkite news high school students from across the state spoke out about environmental changes they hope to see from the state legislature Cronkite news reporter Ashley Holcomb gives us a look to how students took part in today\'s environmental day at the Capitol 60 students from all over the state gathered at the Arizona State Capitol for environmental day the theme this year protecting the Arizona we all share water conservation and preserving Arizona state parks were just a few of the environmental issues discussed high school student Anna Rose Moore Almeida shared her concerns about air pollution its likes me it affects my friends it affects my family and it just it\'s one of the things that I\'ve always fought for since I started sandy Bahr of the Arizona Sierra Club believes it is important for these students to speak out and let lawmakers know what changes they want to see in Environmental Policy to me when when we don\'t care for the environment when we don\'t address climate change that is that\'s not fair to future generations and so I think their voices really need to be heard here at the legislature because it\'s about their future the students are hopeful that the more they voice their concerns the more changes will be made in Phoenix Ashley Holcomb Cronkite news ASU is one of many universities paving the way in finding new solutions to providing natural energy-efficient resources to students on campus as well as maintaining a clean environment Cronkite news reporter Chantal de la joya takes us to UCLA where sustainable technology is giving students the opportunity to spend more productive time outdoors honestly I didn\'t even know that we had them but I think it\'s a great idea she\'s talking about new solar-powered umbrellas which are making it convenient for students to study outside without wearing their mobile devices are about to die we figured not only was it a great way to make sustainable technology visible for students but it\'s also a really great way to encourage students to spend more time outdoors with funding from the University of California\'s green initiative fund Sophie and her group were able to install five umbrellas popular kerckhoffs patio there\'s between three and ten dollars taken out of every single students tuition and that goes into the green initiative fund and then students across campus can apply to receive funding from from the green initiative fund for different sustainable and conservation projects on campus the umbrellas can hold a charge for up to eight hours without sunlight which is great for students to be able to study outdoors I think they\'re really useful it was nice to come out here and still be able to charge my phone also students in shades before we didn\'t used to have these it would be like burning Sun and while these students will graduate and move on University staff predict we\'ll be around to see more of these projects in years ahead I mean I think it\'s very satisfying you need power you device the sun\'s right there cut all the middle middle people out and you just power your device directly and at $2,500 per umbrella these solar advocates say it\'s money well spent in Los Angeles Chantal del Aguila Cronkite news ASU currently has installed ten ngr solar panel devices across all campuses the collaborations with light works has been providing energy efficient solutions for faculty staff and students the City of Phoenix is currently recycling approximately 17,000 pounds a year of glass not all blasts gets recycled reporter Nicole Gutierrez tells us how one company bases its business on old bottles according to the EPA people in the u.s. generated more than 11 million tons of class and 2014 alone and only one-fourth of that glass is recycled but a valley company is rescuing wine bottles to do its part in recycling process this was a perfectly good wine bottle now it\'s on its way to a new life is an example of a glass that might be made from a bottle like this Fredo Amaro is owner of refreshed glass he refreshes old wine bottles into cocktail and water glasses his business has processed more than 1 million bottles in eight years this is a craft we have the ability to do printing and custom engraving as well and then we also make planters some people use these as as shot glasses so we have a fairly wide variety of different functional uses that we can make out of a single wine bottle Meghan circles whether using cups we know the recycled wine bottles is both functional and durable for their restaurants working bars my whole life and on average I\'d say probably a dozen glasses get broke in a week and I probably on the lighter ends whereas these maybe a dozen every couple months McGregor also has classes made specifically for his bar so I like the fact that they\'re all different sides of a slightly different color or something a little bit different about it so these are all the tops of the wine bottles as you can tell so I made these surfboards in my garage and these are a whiskey flight so now if you don\'t want to get just you know one file of whiskey you can take four different kinds and get a sample of all four whiskey\'s according to keep Phoenix beautiful you can do your parts and recycles last by making sure bottles and jars as well as food grade glass containers make it to the recycling bin in the first place remember window panes mirrors light bulbs and treated glass like the ones you find in your car should be disposed elsewhere and the broadcast liner Nicole Kyra\'s

with gallons of water starting from this end and ending with that end but the problem is those plants where we started will be in water for hours and these plants are dry but drip irrigation can fix that we\'re somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent efficient with flood where as drip can get in the 90% range efficient converting to drip cost a thousand dollars per acre a price that some farmers are not able to pay according to Kim Sonic from the Nature Conservancy you have to install a pump you have to have filtered water you have a power cost associated with the farmer takes on and you have a lot of upfront labor to get that equipment in the ground the nature conservancy funds projects throughout the Verde Valley with the help of changed the course a nationwide campaign to restore fresh water change the course purchase companies like REI and coca-cola to offset their water usage by funding projects and build a concentrate see the actual impact in an area that is iconic beautiful a great place to paddle and connected to the health of the watershed now that the project is paid for it\'s up to the Hauser\'s to make it work trying to carry on you know tradition not mess

we were teaching was firing and holding technique so it\'s literally where the the term fight fire with fire comes from we use fire to suppress other fires and with them being structure firefighters they don\'t get the hands-on of getting to light the fires and see the fire interactions and put it into play nearly as often as we do hiding wildfires is different for individual firefighters adrenaline rush your I mean the flames are right there either I mean it\'s right here in funny or it\'s far away but I mean you\'re you\'re just you\'re huffing forty five pounds plus maybe some days

years that you see more of this in restaurants it hasn\'t it hasn\'t hit I think as big as I\'d like to see it but it\'s certainly out there more hope the sustainability culture at El Charro inspires

impoverished countries face it helps them stay in school get better grades and have an opportunity to kind of move beyond where they are today it\'s a game-changer for the entire community and for the kids the drawings will be sent to children in Cambodia to a town where the foundation is currently building a clean water system we\'re going to send the messages to other children far far away over whole other country and it gave the kids a chance to really kind of connect water is the one thing that binds us all together is kind of you know world citizens you know what those kids are gonna

tuned to the World Water Day special on Arizona PBS world on tuesday at six pm today is World Water Day it\'s been observed annually since the United Nations started it in 1993 each year has a different theme around water in current world issues this year water and jobs and Samantha Weatherwax is in our nation\'s capitol talking to some Arizona leaders behind the initiative today is the United Nations World Water Day and experts from the desert came to DC to represent Arizona at the White House water summit earlier today we believe of course that safe clean water is worth the price Katherine Sorenson was one of the many water officials from around the country who traveled to Washington to raise awareness of water issues and to find potential solutions it\'s important for all of us to get together and in DC is a great place to do it and to have a place where we can all get together talk about the issues we\'re facing it see if there\'s innovative solutions that we can share not just across the aisle but also across the country Phoenix and Tucson were highlighted today for their conservation efforts as they are currently in a partnership which allows Phoenix to store water within Toussaint\'s infrastructure so by leveraging the infrastructure of both cities we gained tremendous efficiencies and really create resiliency for both communities Timothy Tom our director of tucson water services is happy with the progress that the partnership is made and is now looking towards the future we are looking at upwards of even close to forty thousand acre feet of water per year that could be stored in Tucson facilities which is about a third of Phoenix\'s allocation forty thousand acre feet is equivalent to a little over 13 billion gallons the more we can come together and work on these issues collaboratively hey that\'s a win-win for everybody other cities in the valley are gaining interest in the Phoenix Tucson partnership which could lead to even greater conservation efforts for Arizona reporting from the White House Samantha Weatherwax Cronkite news there has been a drought in the state of Arizona since 1999 and california state of see with water has the southwest asking how do we do more with less James Ulrich spoke to Arizona officials about what solutions they have for the water shortage the grass here at civic a civic space park is green but that\'s not due to any rain according to the National Weather Service we haven\'t had significant rainfall since februari first this in the valley this is a big concern for Arizona\'s political and business leaders who met today at the arrows at the business water summit in Phoenix when it comes to water shortage in the southwestern United States Senator Jeff Flake doesn\'t want the federal government to get involved we\'re going to have to find offsets it\'s going to involve a lot of negotiating and a lot of serious legislating so just saying that that\'s not an easy fix the days where you could simply rely on the federal government to make massive investments and our long past not everyone agrees with this the Public Policy Institute of California conducted a study last month and formed a policy recommendation in response to the Western drought Ellen henick the center\'s director said the government needs to use their power to help the numerous agencies cooperate over two dozen federal agencies are involved in Western water in one way or another leveraging that authority to really help push state and local partners to come to solutions in in basins where there are some tough challenges the Colorado River Basin forecast center estimates that there\'s a sixty percent chance that Lake Mead will suffer a water shortage by 2018 if this happens there would be an automatic water restriction in Arizona and Nevada and it may be the only circumstance in which flake will support federal government involvement it\'s been postponed because of better rains last year but but it\'s likely going to come as far as new new initiatives or new legislation by I don\'t foresee that I think it can be solved for the most part of the local level there are handful of bills going through the California and Arizona legislators one of these bills SB 1268 was rejected by the Arizona State House of Representatives Cochise County try to impose in a short plan of a 100-year water supply for potential developers in Phoenix James Ulrich Cronkite news some northern Arizona officials are taking another fight to Washington this time over Mojave counties out of control Butera population Cronkite news reporter Katie Bieri found out how federal law has protected these animals maybe a little too well they\'re cute slow-moving and apparently harmless but as the wild burro population has exploded they have taken a toll on resources and threatened Arizona motorists nobody has died yet but they\'re going to that\'s exactly what brought local county officials to Washington this week they met with federal officials and Senator John McCain to talk solutions to the problem if we\'re talking about it then we know about it and then it\'s on our hands right now the boro population sits at more than 4,400 that\'s three times more than our environment can sustain killing the burrows isn\'t an option because it\'s illegal but in a moment of frustration one officials suggested such a step I don\'t want to shoot the burrows nobody does but it takes that sort of rhetoric to get attention sometimes from the outlying areas Ma said he was glad to start a conversation but that long term there needs to be a better solution it\'s basically the Dutch boy putting his finger in the dam and hoping he can stop it from bursting but it\'s a start it\'s a band-aid but it\'s a start in Washington Katie Bieri Cronkite news 3d printing has opened a world of possibilities they\'re being used in schools and businesses across Arizona however reporter ben Brown tells us how it might also damage your health these aren\'t minor health problems we\'re talking about either a recent study shows that certain plastics used in 3d printing release emissions that could lead to cancer heart problems and other serious issues local motors and arizona-based manufacturing company works with 3d printers daily even building a 3d printed car 3d printing allows us to do something we\'ve never done in the past which is build something quickly and then grind it up recycle it and do it again and again and again but like with all new technology complications tend to surface and this one could have serious health implications the problem comes with the process so you\'re taking plastic you\'re melting it extruding it out a little nozzle and it just builds up one layer at a time that melting process can emit toxins a study conducted by researchers from the illinois institute of technology and other universities found that certain plastics such as abs can emit human carcinogens we\'ve actually had the hygienists come in and validate that what we smell is not a toxic chemical but it\'s it\'s like a perfume the hard part is for a home use you don\'t have that advantage and that as another concern for 3d printers becoming more affordable it\'s common to find them in homes or schools but despite the study Reiher says he wouldn\'t shy away from 3d printers honestly I

of the lake by catching them we have not stocked any of our sport fish we have not stocked any fish since early you know earlier this year one Tempe resident hopes this new dam is worth it the only thing I\'m really concerned about is that there\'s a lot of money it\'s gone into building these new floodgates and it\'s a kind of a revolutionary thing that they\'re doing I just hope it works city officials say they did research to find the right damn for the job there were 20 different technologies that we looked at and evaluated and this one was by far the best Tempe leaders warned no one

something with that we try to tell people when they come in what the rules are and also we give out brochures with a map and it has regulations on it basically people aren\'t supposed to remove rocks or objects that they find on the trails even though Park Rangers do their best to preserve Arizona State Parks some hikers and campers don\'t see the harm in taking a little piece of Arizona before they go nicey a rock yes I said I told the tumor and my friends he dad ugh hey she\'s really it\'s like a diet see the tears and the nose and the hives everyone took one Rockwell pretty soon there

were coloring this morning a drop of water but only the older ones could grasp why some people aren\'t getting good water and we\'re trying to build them a water tower to get fresh clean water it\'s part of the planet water foundations efforts to bring clean drinking water to people in third world countries something most of us take for granted you turn on the faucet and you don\'t even think about it or where you go out to water your lawn you don\'t even think about it in educating and involving young children as part of planet waters campaign to bring more awareness to water problems impoverished countries face it helps them stay in school get better grades and have an opportunity to kind of move beyond where they are today it\'s a game-changer for the entire community and for the kids the drawings will be sent to children in Cambodia to a town where the foundation is currently building a clean water system we\'re going to send the messages to other children far far away over whole other country and it gave the kids a chance to really kind of connect water is the one thing that binds us all together is kind of you know world citizens you know what those kids are gonna really appreciate this alright and they\'re going to try and send a message back to you also to see the town in Cambodia received the clean water system and the drawings from children here in Phoenix tuned to the World Water Day special on Arizona PBS world on tuesday at six pm today is World Water Day it\'s been observed annually since the United Nations started it in 1993 each year has a different theme around water in current world issues this year water and jobs and Samantha Weatherwax is in our nation\'s capitol talking to some Arizona leaders behind the initiative today is the United Nations World Water Day and experts from the desert came to DC to represent Arizona at the White House water summit earlier today we believe of course that safe clean water is worth the price Katherine Sorenson was one of the many water officials from around the country who traveled to Washington to raise awareness of water issues and to find potential solutions it\'s important for all of us to get together and in DC is a great place to do it and to have a place where we can all get together talk about the issues we\'re facing it see if there\'s innovative solutions that we can share not just across the aisle but also across the country Phoenix and Tucson were highlighted today for their conservation efforts as they are currently in a partnership which allows Phoenix to store water within Toussaint\'s infrastructure so by leveraging the infrastructure of both cities we gained tremendous efficiencies and really create resiliency for both communities Timothy Tom our director of tucson water services is happy with the progress that the partnership is made and is now looking towards the future we are looking at upwards of even close to forty thousand acre feet of water per year that could be stored in Tucson facilities which is about a third of Phoenix\'s allocation forty thousand acre feet is equivalent to a little over 13 billion gallons the more we can come together and work on these issues collaboratively hey that\'s a win-win for everybody other cities in the valley are gaining interest in the Phoenix Tucson partnership which could lead to even greater conservation efforts for Arizona reporting from the White House Samantha Weatherwax Cronkite news there has been a drought in the state of Arizona since 1999 and california state of see with water has the southwest asking how do we do more with less James Ulrich spoke to Arizona officials about what solutions they have for the water shortage the grass here at civic a civic space park is green but that\'s not due to any rain according to the National Weather Service we haven\'t had significant rainfall since februari first this in the valley this is a big concern for Arizona\'s political and business leaders who met today at the arrows at the business water summit in Phoenix when it comes to water shortage in the southwestern United States Senator Jeff Flake doesn\'t want the federal government to get involved we\'re going to have to find offsets it\'s going to involve a lot of negotiating and a lot of serious legislating so just saying that that\'s not an easy fix the days where you could simply rely on the federal government to make massive investments and our long past not everyone agrees with this the Public Policy Institute of California conducted a study last month and formed a policy recommendation in response to the Western drought Ellen henick the center\'s director said the government needs to use their power to help the numerous agencies cooperate over two dozen federal agencies are involved in Western water in one way or another leveraging that authority to really help push state and local partners to come to solutions in in basins where there are some tough challenges the Colorado River Basin forecast center estimates that there\'s a sixty percent chance that Lake Mead will suffer a water shortage by 2018 if this happens there would be an automatic water restriction in Arizona and Nevada and it may be the only circumstance in which flake will support federal government involvement it\'s been postponed because of better rains last year but but it\'s likely going to come as far as new new initiatives or new legislation by I don\'t foresee that I think it can be solved for the most part of the local level there are handful of bills going through the California and Arizona legislators one of these bills SB 1268 was rejected by the Arizona State House of Representatives Cochise County try to impose in a short plan of a 100-year water supply for potential developers in Phoenix James Ulrich Cronkite news some northern Arizona officials are taking another fight to Washington this time over Mojave counties out of control Butera population Cronkite news reporter Katie Bieri found out how federal law has protected these animals maybe a little too well they\'re cute slow-moving and apparently harmless but as the wild burro population has exploded they have taken a toll on resources and threatened Arizona motorists nobody has died yet but they\'re going to that\'s exactly what brought local county officials to Washington this week they met with federal officials and Senator John McCain to talk solutions to the problem if we\'re talking about it then we know about it and then it\'s on our hands right now the boro population sits at more than 4,400 that\'s three times more than our environment can sustain killing the burrows isn\'t an option because it\'s illegal but in a moment of frustration one officials suggested such a step I don\'t want to shoot the burrows nobody does but it takes that sort of rhetoric to get attention sometimes from the outlying areas Ma said he was glad to start a conversation but that long term there needs to be a better solution it\'s basically the Dutch boy putting his finger in the dam and hoping he can stop it from bursting but it\'s a start it\'s a band-aid but it\'s a start in Washington Katie Bieri Cronkite news 3d printing has opened a world of possibilities they\'re being used in schools and businesses across Arizona however reporter ben Brown tells us how it might also damage your health these aren\'t minor health problems we\'re talking about either a recent study shows that certain plastics used in 3d printing release emissions that could lead to cancer heart problems and other serious issues local motors and arizona-based manufacturing company works with 3d printers daily even building a 3d printed car 3d printing allows us to do something we\'ve never done in the past which is build something quickly and then grind it up recycle it and do it again and again and again but like with all new technology complications tend to surface and this one could have serious health implications the problem comes with the process so you\'re taking plastic you\'re melting it extruding it out a little nozzle and it just builds up one layer at a time that melting process can emit toxins a study conducted by researchers from the illinois institute of technology and other universities found that certain plastics such as abs can emit human carcinogens we\'ve actually had the hygienists come in and validate that what we smell is not a toxic chemical but it\'s it\'s like a perfume the hard part is for a home use you don\'t have that advantage and that as another concern for 3d printers becoming more affordable it\'s common to find them in homes or schools but despite the study Reiher says he wouldn\'t shy away from 3d printers honestly I don\'t think I would caution anybody from buying a 3d printer the key is understanding what you\'re doing according to researchers there is no evidence to suggest a design or make of a printer plays a factor so whether it\'s a large manufacturing 3d printer or a small one used at home caution should be used when 3d printing the study\'s authors also found nylon filament releases a toxin that can

might also damage your health these aren\'t minor health problems we\'re talking about either a recent study shows that certain plastics used in 3d printing release emissions that could lead to cancer heart problems and other serious issues local motors and arizona-based manufacturing company works with 3d printers daily even building a 3d printed car 3d printing allows us to do something we\'ve never done in the past which is build something quickly and then grind it up recycle it and do it again and again and again but like with all new technology complications tend to surface and this one could have serious health implications the problem comes with the process so you\'re taking plastic you\'re melting it extruding it out a little nozzle and it just builds up one layer at a time that melting process can emit toxins a study conducted by researchers from the illinois institute of technology and other universities found that certain plastics such as abs can emit human carcinogens we\'ve actually had the hygienists come in and validate that what we smell is not a toxic chemical but it\'s it\'s like a perfume the hard part is for a home use you don\'t have that advantage and that as another concern for 3d printers becoming more affordable it\'s common to find them in homes or schools but despite the study Reiher says he wouldn\'t shy away from 3d printers honestly I don\'t think I would caution anybody from buying a 3d printer the key is understanding what you\'re doing according to researchers there is no evidence to suggest a design or make of a printer plays a factor so whether it\'s a large manufacturing 3d printer or a small one used at home caution should be used when 3d printing the study\'s authors also found nylon filament releases a toxin that can cause neurologic stomach in heart conditions and one way to limit these toxic emissions is to use biodegradable PLA plastic bin Brown Cronkite news Arizona is dealing with an overpopulation of desert tortoises but you can help Cronkite news reporter James Ulrich explains why the Arizona Game and Fish Department is asking residents to come out of their shell and adopt one tortoises here in the Phoenix area have been breeding a lot for the last century and so there\'s lots and lots of people with pet tortoises that are producing more and more baby tortoises and now there\'s really an overpopulation problem last year there were only 55 tortoises in the adoption center at this time this year that number has increased by more than 30 this guy here is tank he\'s from Kingman Arizona he\'s one of the 86 tortoises here the adoption center aside from the appearance there are several traits that make a tortoise different from a regular house pet some to say that they actually recognize individual people\'s voices they\'ll come in dog doors they learn that that\'s where the food is and they\'ll come in there they have these really human-looking eyes and they seem to kind of be wiser than we then we give them credit for potential owners must have an outdoor space for the tortoise as well as food and water but the registration that\'s the easy part it\'s actually free so you don\'t have to buy one they the ones that come through us on Adoption Day are microchipped already and given a number you just give him a name the tortoises grow to be about 15 pounds but can live for 50 to 100 years so plan on many years with this pet in Phoenix I\'m James Ulrich Cronkite news adoption day for these tortoises is april 9th to apply for adoption visit the Arizona Game and Fish Department\'s website to fill out the form the arizona game and fish department is taking care of an orphan mountain lion kidding Elena Mendoza tells us how she was rescued the mountain lion kitten was trapped in a tree alone and hungry I went to north phoenix today where the kitten is being rehabilitated her condition is was as bad as I\'ve seen maybe a little bit worse Arizona Game and Fish say they received a call yesterday from Animal Control in cells Arizona about a baby mountain lion trapped in a tree her sibling didn\'t make it found at the bottom of that same tree could been several days very likely with several days that she was away from her mom justice Allen says she suspects the mother also died because she would have brought her kitten down so normally we would we wouldn\'t interfere with with kittens in this case we could tell from the weight of the kitten that we found that we was trapped that the mother was not in the picture Arizona Game and Fish officials say the mountain lion kitten is about this big and weighs only 15 pounds when she should weigh about 30 pounds at the age of five to six months they estimate this kitten would have died without intervention the results of her bloodwork indicated that her emaciation and dehydration was significant but doesn\'t appear to cause any long-term damage to her body the good news is that she ate half a rabbit this morning so you know so those are the things are excited about we\'re gonna do what we can but just bringing a young animal young mammal in like this they very quickly get used to having people around them justice Allen says it\'s unclear at the moment if they will be able to release her back into the wild if and when she makes a full recovery Arizona Game and Fish advises anyone who sees a mountain lion kitten or any other baby wild animals to leave it alone in Phoenix Elena Mendoza Cronkite news that\'s it for Cronkite news tonight we are proud to be the news division of Arizona

heart problems and other serious issues local motors and arizona-based manufacturing company works with 3d printers daily even building a 3d printed car 3d printing allows us to do something we\'ve never done in the past which is build something quickly and then grind it up recycle it and do it again and again and again but like with all new technology complications tend to surface and this one could have serious health implications the problem comes with the process so you\'re taking plastic you\'re melting it extruding it out a little nozzle and it just builds up one layer at a time that melting process can emit toxins a study conducted by researchers from the illinois institute of technology and other universities found that certain plastics such as abs can emit human carcinogens we\'ve actually had the hygienists come in and validate that what we smell is not a toxic chemical but it\'s it\'s like a perfume the hard part is for a home use you don\'t have that advantage and that as another concern for 3d printers becoming more affordable it\'s common to find them in homes or schools but despite the study Reiher says he wouldn\'t shy away from 3d printers honestly I don\'t think I would caution anybody from buying a 3d printer the key is understanding what you\'re doing according to researchers there is no evidence to suggest a design or make of a printer plays a factor so whether it\'s a large manufacturing 3d printer or a small one used at home caution should be used when 3d printing the study\'s authors also found nylon filament releases a toxin that can cause neurologic stomach in heart conditions and one way to limit these toxic emissions is to use biodegradable PLA plastic bin Brown Cronkite news Arizona is dealing with an overpopulation of desert tortoises but you can help Cronkite news reporter James Ulrich explains why the Arizona Game and Fish Department is asking residents to come out of their shell and adopt one tortoises here in the Phoenix area have been breeding a lot for the last century and so there\'s lots and lots of people with pet tortoises that are producing more and more baby tortoises and now there\'s really an overpopulation problem last year there were only 55 tortoises in the adoption center at this time this year that number has increased by more than 30 this guy here is tank he\'s from Kingman Arizona he\'s one of the 86 tortoises here the adoption center aside from the appearance there are several traits that make a tortoise different from a regular house pet some to say that they actually recognize individual people\'s voices they\'ll come in dog doors they learn that that\'s where the food is and they\'ll come in there they have these really human-looking eyes and they seem to kind of be wiser than we then we give them credit for potential owners must have an outdoor space for the tortoise as well as food and water but the registration that\'s the easy part it\'s actually free so you don\'t have to buy one they the ones that come through us on Adoption Day are microchipped already and given a number you just give him a name the tortoises grow to be about 15 pounds but can live for 50 to 100 years so plan on many years with this pet in Phoenix I\'m James Ulrich Cronkite news adoption day for these tortoises is april 9th to apply for adoption visit the Arizona Game and Fish Department\'s website to fill out the form the arizona game and fish department is taking care of an orphan mountain lion kidding Elena Mendoza tells us how she was rescued the mountain lion kitten was trapped in a tree alone and hungry I went to north phoenix today where the kitten is being rehabilitated her condition is was as bad as I\'ve seen maybe a little bit worse Arizona Game and Fish say they received a call yesterday from Animal Control in cells Arizona about a baby mountain lion trapped in a tree her sibling didn\'t make it found at the bottom of that same tree could been several days very likely with several days that she was away from her mom justice Allen says she suspects the mother also died because she would have brought her kitten down so normally we would we wouldn\'t interfere with with kittens in this case we could tell from the weight of the kitten that we found that we was trapped that the mother was not in the picture Arizona Game and Fish officials say the mountain lion kitten is about this big and weighs only 15 pounds when she should weigh about 30 pounds at the age of five to six months they estimate this kitten would have died without intervention the results of her bloodwork indicated that her emaciation and dehydration was significant but doesn\'t appear to cause any long-term damage to her body the good news is that she ate half a rabbit this morning so you know so those are the things are excited about we\'re gonna do what we can but just bringing a young animal young mammal in like this they very quickly get used to having people around them justice Allen says it\'s unclear at the moment if they will be able to release her back into the wild if and when she makes a full recovery Arizona Game and Fish advises anyone who sees a mountain lion kitten or any other baby wild animals to leave it alone in Phoenix Elena Mendoza Cronkite news that\'s it for Cronkite news tonight we are proud to be the news division of Arizona

people but mostly seniors or targeted by healthcare fraud our specialists today is William bill Orlick yes with some unclear counsel when for the first board yes and he\'s an attorney yes and Bill\'s specialty is working on cases of healthcare fraud for seniors oh oh absolutely but today we\'re gonna we\'re gonna zero in on the senior aspect of it absolutely definitely Oh tell me how long you been doing this and what was it that wants you to be interested how were you inspired to be interested in this area well thank you for having me on the show today barb I greatly appreciate it about this important topic I started working as a lawyer 20 years ago I know I look like then that but I was involved in health care type of cases and fraud in general I had the privilege of working with one of the I believe premier trial attorneys in the country which is David Boies and I started working on these cases when I was at boys schiller many years ago and I\'ve been continuing ever since so you\'ve been doing Wow yes and I\'m sure that you have had some very interesting cases we have one of the one of the most prevalent cases or or situations that you found yourself covering working with their the unfortunately fraud is a booming business as we say and it impacts many segments of our economy most prevalent is the healthcare segment I type the cases I work on are false what we call False Claims Act and False Claims Act is a federal statute that goes back to 1863 during the Civil War the Union Army was receiving shoddy material shoes that disintegrated when the soldiers March guns that didn\'t fire broken-down mules things of that nature so in 1863 Congress enacted what\'s called the False Claims Act also known as Lincoln\'s law and it essentially allows individuals who have discovered fraud or improper conduct occurring where government dollars are involved to bring a case there\'s a it\'s a long Latin phrase essentially they\'re called ki tam suits and it basically says he or she who brings a lawsuit on behalf of the government a whistleblower is allowed to partake if there are fruits as a result of the suit in the for taking the fruits of that suit new jersey followed the government\'s lead if you will and in 2008 the state of New Jersey also enacted a False Claims Act at the state level for state dollars so the types of cases that we see in my practice over the many years with the healthcare fraud deal with Medicare Medicaid TRICARE which is the government aspect of military of healthcare and the Federal Employees Health Benefit program which is for the civilian employees the key to the statutes for these type of crimes to be brought to justice under this particular form this particular law is for there to be government dollars so there has to be a government dollar in law right all of these programs implicate government funds so we have seen the gambit of schemes and proper conduct whatever you want to characterize it and we can talk about some of those today lots of government dollars flowing into Farm Big Pharma and Medicare and sure and medications are out yes with reasons to get more than they\'re entitled to the second and it\'s a big problem because we hear all the time why is health care so expensive why does it keep going up so much every year that\'s a big question it is very much so and it\'s a good question and it\'s one that needs to be asked more I think quite frankly I for 13 years I was adjunct professor at see a law school one of the classes are taught in South Carolina so we talked about these types of topics and unfortunately the healthcare economy in particular depending on what report you read the FBI has their crimes financial crime statistic report that comes out every year anywhere from three to ten percent of the healthcare economy is subject to waste fraud and abuse that\'s outrageous it\'s ridiculously high in addition were operating under a new phenomenon that has come up recently and it\'s impacted everyone government sector private sector what-have-you where if you go to get a band-aid that\'s to say hypothetically on December 31st that band-aids going to - $2.50 if you go from one bandit January first now that band-aids going to go up by so much percent so instead of it being 250 now like it was one day just because it\'s January first it\'s gonna the price is gonna go up there could be $3 now whatever the problem that you have those types of incremental increases they go on and on year after year and just because it\'s a new year no other segments of the economy does that if you go you know buy clothing to go to a restaurant the prices don\'t go up every year just because it\'s January 1st thank goodness but for some reason the healthcare portion of our economy has gotten locked into the system and we see this on many of the different boards and committees that I serve on we\'re at the municipal level we\'re in the ordering the private my private law practice where our health care premiums are going to go up so doesn\'t do it federal or state fiscal years it\'s a counted year there is that\'s what skin is or yes there in person yes well that\'s an exorbitant price and I think they\'ve all become aware of it having been treated by people in the medical field and or in the hospital sure you get that statement that bill and we see what they\'re charging us for yes seems like one band-aid or something that we don\'t recognize this exactly what it means but it could be something like one bad day bring your own band-aid yes and they won\'t let you like most places if you go to a restaurant right you can\'t bring it on foot or whatever there\'s a word for it and try and I\'ve been or that word for for a long time and it\'s a problem and again just because it goes from the center of 31st of the last year to January 1st of the next year we shouldn\'t get hit with a price increase all the time right it\'s unsustainable on so many different levels I think we see it in the municipal government like I said and we also see it in the private sector you know for my law firm I\'m a managing partner of our firm those are real decisions we have to make every year about the level of benefits that we can provide to our employees it\'s it\'s a real problem and they you know if you talk to most organizations anywhere from 80 to 85 percent of the budgets now or for people that\'s important people are important we have to make sure they have healthcare retirement what happening however that\'s a zero-sum game the PI is only so big I can\'t go past a hundred percent and if I\'m already at 81 percent and then I get hidden out with another increase next year for my healthcare expenditure now my PI goes to 82 percent or 83 percent I don\'t have money to buy panels or if it\'s a school school buses or if it\'s a town trucks things of that nature so it\'s a real crisis and I\'m surprised that we haven\'t done more as a society to get a handle on this and I\'m hoping more attention through these types of avenues like we have here today will help towards that end well the crisis that it\'s the senior population is what we hear about seniors having to make make the decision about what get the blood pressure medication or there or heart medication or whether they should buy food or pay their electric bill and that\'s the decision that you know I mean I as a senior feel very you know deeply about sure about this especially for seniors who are isolated they don\'t have any kind of coverage other than Medicare they don\'t have a gap coverage or anything to pick up additional cost and when they\'re hit with those extremely high medical bills it\'s it\'s very painful yes and I have somebody who hopes to be a senior one day good lord willing feel exactly the same concerns going forward and that\'s where I kind of see things as they\'re happening now and hoping that we can get a better handle on some of this financially and otherwise and to your earlier question Barbara as well the some of the schemes or scams that you know improper conduct however we want to characterize it that we\'ve seen in the practice and have over the years there\'s two components really to the health care system there\'s what we call the group health or the physician health care provider and then you also have the pharmacy side of things which could be a pharmacy benefit manager what-have-you what we have seen on the healthcare side are many different mechanisms to gain payment and to scam the system if you will it could be billing for services never rendered so you go in to your health care provider you get X Y &amp; Z but they bill you not only for X Y &amp; Z but a B and C very common another thing that we have seen on the group health side as well you\'re going in for a basic metabolic panel you\'re going through your blood tests there\'s 10 tests that are grouped in that and it\'s done on purpose for billing purposes to save money so it\'s correct a good way to put it absolutely those 10 tests now that could be potassium it could be cholesterol you know what we would consider it your basic metabolic panel and there\'s a flat feet it\'s supposed to be associated and what they call the that\'s called cpt codes current procedural terminology codes and it\'s bit the way that health care system does if you\'ll see sometimes so that let\'s just say hypothetically that\'s test is supposed to cost you $70 a healthcare provider can pull one of those 10 tests out bill you individually for the nine and that test now it\'s going to cost three hundred dollars now you\'re going to be billed for nine individually as opposed to ten in a group or individual clause correct and the one that got pulled out it\'s not done it\'s not done so not only is the billing a little improper shall we say but you also may not getting tests that you might need my question right exactly listen so that\'s something that we\'ve see another area that\'s problematic is what we call up Cody so you\'re going to your healthcare provider you\'re going for your yearly physical healthcare provider sees you makes notes fills out the paperwork for the billing department instead of saying that I saw you for a physical I\'m gonna say I saw you a for a follow-up for an advanced infection so now I get a higher spend as the provider reimbursement and that\'s another area that we well some follow-up only take five minutes and then there\'s that as well that the quote follow-up is take that minute is it really father I\'m gonna take a look at it and see how it looks like much better than shouldn\'t be fine you know yes goodbye but under those CPT codes that we just talked about the it\'ll be reimbursed at a higher amount than just a physical so that\'s another area that has to be looked at um say you\'re hospitalized in your you know your your primary physician is you know you\'re under scary mm-hmm he\'s gotta and associated working in this and he asks and to stop me the check we\'ve seen a lot of different scenarios if you will one of the more prevalent scenarios under the CPT code that the government has has established that the lead physician if you will doesn\'t necessarily have to see a patient however they have to be on site god forbid something happens during exam and they\'ll have another maybe a nurse practitioner or a physician\'s assistant who are going to make less money but they\'ll go and see the patients as if they were the doctor and the doctors not even not only are they not in that room they\'re not even on site and that\'s it that problem and then it can be a problem they yes they are you doing the day and doctor asking stuff in you know how are you doing today right and say okay yeah on this one they walk out gobias and others yes thank you back in their problem and you don\'t even know their names so you want direct yep hard to follow up on the pharmacy side we see a whole other array of activity going on that\'s that\'s improper we have seen instances where there\'s something called shorted where if you are say on a statin it\'s going to be a long term you\'re going to chronic you\'re going to be out of the rest of your life to do a mail-order prescription for 90 pills you only get 85 no one sits there and counts out on each pill as they come in doesn\'t sound like a lot but remember that\'s over the life of a prescription good persons gonna have forever that adds up very quickly and you only see it by looking at what we call the paid claims data so that you see okay I\'m supposed to come back and get my my my pills on July 31st but because I ran out I\'m coming back on July 25th you look at the paid claims data you\'ll see when it\'s your that one short right good thing correct correct and it could be problematic for another reason as you indicated earlier some of these people don\'t have the means to keep going out and buying more ahead of time of when they\'re supposed to be in way so that\'s another problem there\'s no plan at the pharmacy giving a few little your yes prescription right exactly to hold over until the description right kicks in another thing that we\'ve seen on the pharmacy side is something called switching so if a drug is a branded drug and it\'s getting ready to go off pattern will become a generic though rx spend as we call it the prescription span is obviously going to be much different much lower under a generic as with the other brand we\'ve found instances certain times where pharmacies will switch you to another branded drug before the other drug goes off Pat I become a scenario so again there\'s a higher alright we call our expats a result as well which is which is a real problem for for a whole host of reasons well I know that generic drugs are supposed to be identical they\'re supposed to be under the FDA guidelines they\'re supposed to have the equivalent whatever it is that they\'ve been generic from shall we say for a lot better like a better perhaps lutely right and because of those issues sometimes they lose their efficacy now it\'s another problem that that occurs because oftentimes the pharmacy the pharmacy benefit managers will fill prescriptions with invalid prescriber numbers the problem you have there is that they\'re supposed to be under the contracts doing something what we call it Dean you are run utilization review checking for such things as country indications between different drugs and that you\'re paying for that service to be done as part of your membership well it\'s impossible to do a drug utilization review if you have invalid prescriber numbers because you can\'t even call the health care professionals aspect to check absolutely right that\'s another problem so these are different areas and we try to make people aware of going forward and again to your point unfortunately it does tend to fall heavier on the senior population because there\'s also a for lack of a better word of gentleman Jim enumeration issued here my generation was taught to question everything so we\'re always questioned stuff but certain seniors don\'t necessarily come from that my friend so if you have a individual who okay well this is my doctor they\'re supposed to know better I\'m going to rely on them that becomes problematic now because they are relying and unfortunately we have found instances or some individuals will prey on that and use that to their advantage well what the generic medications I am I\'m a prime example of generic medications having side effects that can be devastating and sometimes you don\'t know that the generic medication that you you are Kelly are picking up at this point in your medication that you\'ve been getting on a regular basis has changed until you start having symptoms that are not you know and I think one one of the issues with that is that not everyone realizes or reads the country patients and the side effects on the medication that they\'re they\'re taking sure and to maxim up with whatever symptoms that they\'re affect you know that are affecting them sure that\'s that\'s a good situation that\'s a problem that I think you know should be absolutely because I know that they say that that put the drug is the same mm-hmm and the amount of the drugs the same so it\'s the fillers that they use to manufacture sure to color it or whatever are different yes all the more reason why the drug utilization review is so vital for many patients and again it can\'t be conducted if there\'s incomplete information of Scripture being filled in an invalid prescribed right so that\'s the utilization review who do you are at organization how often are they caught or stopped or what\'s what does it look like out there with you know being able to zero in on this and do something about it unfortunately not good for for the side of trying to correct this behavior there are hotlines you know it\'s a lot like what we see now on the national security level you see something say it\'s something if you you uncover questionable conduct whether it be on the pharmacist either on their health care side it\'s important to bring it to the right people\'s attention the state of New Jersey has a Medicaid fraud hotline that you can call the Health and Human Service Department at the federal level also has a hotline that you can call as CMS the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services also based at Washington as well unfortunately a lot of people don\'t know what to look for that\'s one of the reasons I think it was so important and I thank you again for having me this afternoon I\'d like to see those those sorts of cents on the bottom of our screen so that we get that pickle sure and once you report it there\'s an investigation that will occur the problem that you have a lot of the times though resources are such that once it\'s even reported sometimes it\'s art you get the correct either state or federal investigators prosecutors involved this is something that I deal with almost on a daily basis with a lot of my cases unfortunately but again I think if the trend is to kind of to get people to get out there to have this more prevalently known but this is occurring what to look for I think that goes a long way to getting us on eventually getting this corrected because we can\'t afford it unfortunately no really be one of my questions because and I\'m wondering how do we get this basic information and all of its offspring out there to to the seniors so that they understand it and then they understand a thing that we understand we have options and and you know that they can design and and if they resolved you know what is the penalty so those are two questions how do we get how do we get it out there well what you\'re doing you do presentations to groups I did and what you\'re doing quite frankly having a show like this where we\'re reaching people in the community is huge this doesn\'t happen all the time so thank you this is a first step I think in addition to this you know getting the information out whether it\'s pamphlets flyers presentations what have you making people aware that this is occurring what to start to look for how to you know you brought this up earlier when you\'re looking at your bills your EOB s you know explanation of benefits to you know keep an eye on that to know what to look for is important as well and then also to get that next step of okay I\'ve seen this now I know what this they report it feel comfortable with that the the HIPAA laws are very very strict when it comes to information but there is what\'s called a crime fraud exception so if you do uncover something it\'s you can report that to the appropriate governmental or legal authority to be able to help I\'m wondering if maybe it\'s not reported as much because something needs to be looked into I guess blowing whistle on the doctor or pharmacist you know we don\'t get the Big Pharma but you know those people that we trust you know and I always felt that it\'s really important that you have a lot of trust in their in your you know your position very good team of physicians these seniors we lined up with a lot of specialists almost juniors do two plus you were your pharmacist you know you really better have a lot of trust in your pharmacist know that your pharmacist never relationship with you yes feel it could be a fair agreed yes and I think you know if I may borrow an expression from an error mom gone by trust well verify it\'s okay to ask questions it\'s okay it\'s a you know hey I bet this explanation of benefits here I don\'t recognize this name I don\'t recognize system as charged can you help me that if people go a long way as well to reinforcing the trust that\'s already there but also addresses some of the concerns we\'ve identified this afternoon I think that you know when you receive that the charges sir there are things that are highlighted or redlined or start or whatever that your doctor is expected to address linked against the company of the from the the lab work yes it depends on how the lab has set it up with the health care provider yes there\'s various arrangements that they have usually the rain I know personally when I see mine there\'s something that\'s an issue I\'ll see a range I need to drive ready and I think that I think most people should get a copy there that block work there that lab work and I\'ve compared to the the previous one to see greater if there are changes you know sometimes you pick up something the doctor it\'s not comparing this to three months ago correct sir yes that\'s a great is doctor what does this mean I\'m these numbers important they work yes never hurts the question that\'s totally within your rights true I want to thank you this\'ll it\'s a lot here and a nice I need to know or I guess the perpetrators of this are they are they being fined or penalized on any scale that makes it that matters it\'s never quite enough in my view the issues that you have are there\'s what we call compensatory damages in the law which means you know charged me $100 for something should\'ve only charged me 50 for the 50 extra would be what we call compensatory then there\'s something they call punitive where I\'m trying to stop you from doing this again so I\'m not going to discharge you get the $50 back but I\'m also going to hit you with another $100 fine if you will my experience has been at this point anyway and you know we\'re trying to work on getting this more that the penalty part of the legal phase if you will is not nearly what should be to try to get some of this stuff so that\'s an excellent way built let\'s that\'s an awful lot for taking the time to to put all this out there for us because there are so many of us seniors that really don\'t know what\'s happening and large-scale is happening and I\'m hoping that this will help us to be able to get a fair shake there were a couple of things that could come out to ask you but whether the time sure but I know that you mentioned the durable power of attorney and so perhaps we can revisit this again sometime in the future and you can discuss those four absolutely I\'d be happy to come back and discuss that and thank you for allowing me the

and unfortunately the healthcare economy in particular depending on what report you read the FBI has their crimes financial crime statistic report that comes out every year anywhere from three to ten percent of the healthcare economy is subject to waste fraud and abuse that\'s outrageous it\'s ridiculously high in addition were operating under a new phenomenon that has come up recently and it\'s impacted everyone government sector private sector what-have-you where if you go to get a band-aid that\'s to say hypothetically on December 31st that band-aids going to - $2.50 if you go from one bandit January first now that band-aids going to go up by so much percent so instead of it being 250 now like it was one day just because it\'s January first it\'s gonna the price is gonna go up there could be $3 now whatever the problem that you have those types of incremental increases they go on and on year after year and just because it\'s a new year no other segments of the economy does that if you go you know buy clothing to go to a restaurant the prices don\'t go up every year just because it\'s January 1st thank goodness but for some reason the healthcare portion of our economy has gotten locked into the system and we see this on many of the different boards and committees that I serve on we\'re at the municipal level we\'re in the ordering the private my private law practice where our health care premiums are going to go up so doesn\'t do it federal or state fiscal years it\'s a counted year there is that\'s what skin is or yes there in person yes well that\'s an exorbitant price and I think they\'ve all become aware of it having been treated by people in the medical field and or in the hospital sure you get that statement that bill and we see what they\'re charging us for yes seems like one band-aid or something that we don\'t recognize this exactly what it means but it could be something like one bad day bring your own band-aid yes and they won\'t let you like most places if you go to a restaurant right you can\'t bring it on foot or whatever there\'s a word for it and try and I\'ve been or that word for for a long time and it\'s a problem and again just because it goes from the center of 31st of the last year to January 1st of the next year we shouldn\'t get hit with a price increase all the time right it\'s unsustainable on so many different levels I think we see it in the municipal government like I said and we also see it in the private sector you know for my law firm I\'m a managing partner of our firm those are real decisions we have to make every year about the level of benefits that we can provide to our employees it\'s it\'s a real problem and they you know if you talk to most organizations anywhere from 80 to 85 percent of the budgets now or for people that\'s important people are important we have to make sure they have healthcare retirement what happening however that\'s a zero-sum game the PI is only so big I can\'t go past a hundred percent and if I\'m already at 81 percent and then I get hidden out with another increase next year for my healthcare expenditure now my PI goes to 82 percent or 83 percent I don\'t have money to buy panels or if it\'s a school school buses or if it\'s a town trucks things of that nature so it\'s a real crisis and I\'m surprised that we haven\'t done more as a society to get a handle on this and I\'m hoping more attention through these types of avenues like we have here today will help towards that end well the crisis that it\'s the senior population is what we hear about seniors having to make make the decision about what get the blood pressure medication or there or heart medication or whether they should buy food or pay their electric bill and that\'s the decision that you know I mean I as a senior feel very you know deeply about sure about this especially for seniors who are isolated they don\'t have any kind of coverage other than Medicare they don\'t have a gap coverage or anything to pick up additional cost and when they\'re hit with those extremely high medical bills it\'s it\'s very painful yes and I have somebody who hopes to be a senior one day good lord willing feel exactly the same concerns going forward and that\'s where I kind of see things as they\'re happening now and hoping that we can get a better handle on some of this financially and otherwise and to your earlier question Barbara as well the some of the schemes or scams that you know improper conduct however we want to characterize it that we\'ve seen in the practice and have over the years there\'s two components really to the health care system there\'s what we call the group health or the physician health care provider and then you also have the pharmacy side of things which could be a pharmacy benefit manager what-have-you what we have seen on the healthcare side are many different mechanisms to gain payment and to scam the system if you will it could be billing for services never rendered so you go in to your health care provider you get X Y &amp; Z but they bill you not only for X Y &amp; Z but a B and C very common another thing that we have seen on the group health side as well you\'re going in for a basic metabolic panel you\'re going through your blood tests there\'s 10 tests that are grouped in that and it\'s done on purpose for billing purposes to save money so it\'s correct a good way to put it absolutely those 10 tests now that could be potassium it could be cholesterol you know what we would consider it your basic metabolic panel and there\'s a flat feet it\'s supposed to be associated and what they call the that\'s called cpt codes current procedural terminology codes and it\'s bit the way that health care system does if you\'ll see sometimes so that let\'s just say hypothetically that\'s test is supposed to cost you $70 a healthcare provider can pull one of those 10 tests out bill you individually for the nine and that test now it\'s going to cost three hundred dollars now you\'re going to be billed for nine individually as opposed to ten in a group or individual clause correct and the one that got pulled out it\'s not done it\'s not done so not only is the billing a little improper shall we say but you also may not getting tests that you might need my question right exactly listen so that\'s something that we\'ve see another area that\'s problematic is what we call up Cody so you\'re going to your healthcare provider you\'re going for your yearly physical healthcare provider sees you makes notes fills out the paperwork for the billing department instead of saying that I saw you for a physical I\'m gonna say I saw you a for a follow-up for an advanced infection so now I get a higher spend as the provider reimbursement and that\'s another area that we well some follow-up only take five minutes and then there\'s that as well that the quote follow-up is take that minute is it really father I\'m gonna take a look at it and see how it looks like much better than shouldn\'t be fine you know yes goodbye but under those CPT codes that we just talked about the it\'ll be reimbursed at a higher amount than just a physical so that\'s another area that has to be looked at um say you\'re hospitalized in your you know your your primary physician is you know you\'re under scary mm-hmm he\'s gotta and associated working in this and he asks and to stop me the check we\'ve seen a lot of different scenarios if you will one of the more prevalent scenarios under the CPT code that the government has has established that the lead physician if you will doesn\'t necessarily have to see a patient however they have to be on site god forbid something happens during exam and they\'ll have another maybe a nurse practitioner or a physician\'s assistant who are going to make less money but they\'ll go and see the patients as if they were the doctor and the doctors not even not only are they not in that room they\'re not even on site and that\'s it that problem and then it can be a problem they yes they are you doing the day and doctor asking stuff in you know how are you doing today right and say okay yeah on this one they walk out gobias and others yes thank you back in their problem and you don\'t even know their names so you want direct yep hard to follow up on the pharmacy side we see a whole other array of activity going on that\'s that\'s improper we have seen instances where there\'s something called shorted where if you are say on a statin it\'s going to be a long term you\'re going to chronic you\'re going to be out of the rest of your life to do a mail-order prescription for 90 pills you only get 85 no one sits there and counts out on each pill as they come in doesn\'t sound like a lot but remember that\'s over the life of a prescription good persons gonna have forever that adds up very quickly and you only see it by looking at what we call the paid claims data so that you see okay I\'m supposed to come back and get my my my pills on July 31st but because I ran out I\'m coming back on July 25th you look at the paid claims data you\'ll see when it\'s your that one short right good thing correct correct and it could be problematic for another reason as you indicated earlier some of these people don\'t have the means to keep going out and buying more ahead of time of when they\'re supposed to be in way so that\'s another problem there\'s no plan at the pharmacy giving a few little your yes prescription right exactly to hold over until the description right kicks in another thing that we\'ve seen on the pharmacy side is something called switching so if a drug is a branded drug and it\'s getting ready to go off pattern will become a generic though rx spend as we call it the prescription span is obviously going to be much different much lower under a generic as with the other brand we\'ve found instances certain times where pharmacies will switch you to another branded drug before the other drug goes off Pat I become a scenario so again there\'s a higher alright we call our expats a result as well which is which is a real problem for for a whole host of reasons well I know that generic drugs are supposed to be identical they\'re supposed to be under the FDA guidelines they\'re supposed to have the equivalent whatever it is that they\'ve been generic from shall we say for a lot better like a better perhaps lutely right and because of those issues sometimes they lose their efficacy now it\'s another problem that that occurs because oftentimes the pharmacy the pharmacy benefit managers will fill prescriptions with invalid prescriber numbers the problem you have there is that they\'re supposed to be under the contracts doing something what we call it Dean you are run utilization review checking for such things as country indications between different drugs and that you\'re paying for that service to be done as part of your membership well it\'s impossible to do a drug utilization review if you have invalid prescriber numbers because you can\'t even call the health care professionals aspect to check absolutely right that\'s another problem so these are different areas and we try to make people aware of going forward and again to your point unfortunately it does tend to fall heavier on the senior population because there\'s also a for lack of a better word of gentleman Jim enumeration issued here my generation was taught to question everything so we\'re always questioned stuff but certain seniors don\'t necessarily come from that my friend so if you have a individual who okay well this is my doctor they\'re supposed to know better I\'m going to rely on them that becomes problematic now because they are relying and unfortunately we have found instances or some individuals will prey on that and use that to their advantage well what the generic medications I am I\'m a prime example of generic medications having side effects that can be devastating and sometimes you don\'t know that the generic medication that you you are Kelly are picking up at this point in your medication that you\'ve been getting on a regular basis has changed until you start having symptoms that are not you know and I think one one of the issues with that is that not everyone realizes or reads the country patients and the side effects on the medication that they\'re they\'re taking sure and to maxim up with whatever symptoms that they\'re affect you know that are affecting them sure that\'s that\'s a good situation that\'s a problem that I think you know should be absolutely because I know that they say that that put the drug is the same mm-hmm and the amount of the drugs the same so it\'s the fillers that they use to manufacture sure to color it or whatever are different yes all the more reason why the drug utilization review is so vital for many patients and again it can\'t be conducted if there\'s incomplete information of Scripture being filled in an invalid prescribed right so that\'s the utilization review who do you are at organization how often are they caught or stopped or what\'s what does it look like out there with you know being able to zero in on this and do something about it unfortunately not good for for the side of trying to correct this behavior there are hotlines you know it\'s a lot like what we see now on the national security level you see something say it\'s something if you you uncover questionable conduct whether it be on the pharmacist either on their health care side it\'s important to bring it to the right people\'s attention the state of New Jersey has a Medicaid fraud hotline that you can call the Health and Human Service Department at the federal level also has a hotline that you can call as CMS the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services also based at Washington as well unfortunately a lot of people don\'t know what to look for that\'s one of the reasons I think it was so important and I thank you again for having me this afternoon I\'d like to see those those sorts of cents on the bottom of our screen so that we get that pickle sure and once you report it there\'s an investigation that will occur the problem that you have a lot of the times though resources are such that once it\'s even reported sometimes it\'s art you get the correct either state or federal investigators prosecutors involved this is something that I deal with almost on a daily basis with a lot of my cases unfortunately but again I think if the trend is to kind of to get people to get out there to have this more prevalently known but this is occurring what to look for I think that goes a long way to getting us on eventually getting this corrected because we can\'t afford it unfortunately no really be one of my questions because and I\'m wondering how do we get this basic information and all of its offspring out there to to the seniors so that they understand it and then they understand a thing that we understand we have options and and you know that they can design and and if they resolved you know what is the penalty so those are two questions how do we get how do we get it out there well what you\'re doing you do presentations to groups I did and what you\'re doing quite frankly having a show like this where we\'re reaching people in the community is huge this doesn\'t happen all the time so thank you this is a first step I think in addition to this you know getting the information out whether it\'s pamphlets flyers presentations what have you making people aware that this is occurring what to start to look for how to you know you brought this up earlier when you\'re looking at your bills your EOB s you know explanation of benefits to you know keep an eye on that to know what to look for is important as well and then also to get that next step of okay I\'ve seen this now I know what this they report it feel comfortable with that the the HIPAA laws are very very strict when it comes to information but there is what\'s called a crime fraud exception so if you do uncover something it\'s you can report that to the appropriate governmental or legal authority to be able to help I\'m wondering if maybe it\'s not reported as much because something needs to be looked into I guess blowing whistle on the doctor or pharmacist you know we don\'t get the Big Pharma but you know those people that we trust you know and I always felt that it\'s really important that you have a lot of trust in their in your you know your position very good team of physicians these seniors we lined up with a lot of specialists almost juniors do two plus you were your pharmacist you know you really better have a lot of trust in your pharmacist know that your pharmacist never relationship with you yes feel it could be a fair agreed yes and I think you know if I may borrow an expression from an error mom gone by trust well verify it\'s okay to ask questions it\'s okay it\'s a you know hey I bet this explanation of benefits here I don\'t recognize this name I don\'t recognize system as charged can you help me that if people go a long way as well to reinforcing the trust that\'s already there but also addresses some of the concerns we\'ve identified this afternoon I think that you know when you receive that the charges sir there are things that are highlighted or redlined or start or whatever that your doctor is expected to address linked against the company of the from the the lab work yes it depends on how the lab has set it up with the health care provider yes there\'s various arrangements that they have usually the rain I know personally when I see mine there\'s something that\'s an issue I\'ll see a range I need to drive ready and I think that I think most people should get a copy there that block work there that lab work and I\'ve compared to the the previous one to see greater if there are changes you know sometimes you pick up something the doctor it\'s not comparing this to three months ago correct sir yes that\'s a great is doctor what does this mean I\'m these numbers important they work yes never hurts the question that\'s totally within your rights true I want to thank you this\'ll it\'s a lot here and a nice I need to know or I guess the perpetrators of this are they are they being fined or penalized on any scale that makes it that matters it\'s never quite enough in my view the issues that you have are there\'s what we call compensatory damages in the law which means you know charged me $100 for something should\'ve only charged me 50 for the 50 extra would be what we call compensatory then there\'s something they call punitive where I\'m trying to stop you from doing this again so I\'m not going to discharge you get the $50 back but I\'m also going to hit you with another $100 fine if you will my experience has been at this point anyway and you know we\'re trying to work on getting this more that the penalty part of the legal phase if you will is not nearly what should be to try to get some of this stuff so that\'s an excellent way built let\'s that\'s an awful lot for taking the time to to put all this out there for us because there are so many of us seniors that really don\'t know what\'s happening and large-scale is happening and I\'m hoping that this will help us to be able to get a fair shake there were a couple of things that could come out to ask you but whether the time sure but I know that you mentioned the durable power of attorney and so perhaps we can revisit this again sometime in the future and you can discuss those four absolutely I\'d be happy to come back and discuss that and thank you for allowing me the opportunity to talk about this important topic today and this is a good first step getting information out so thank you thank you and thank you for watching this special statement that was it is a

Kelly William Kelly he\'s his therapy was amazing the mostly diet and nutrition and some you know other other stuff of detoxification but their way you know what quite well yeah Gerson Therapy is primarily juicing many many many times a day right I think they juice 13 times a day those cattle juice on vegetable juice right but it what\'s very very I believe yeah yeah yeah diet is very key I mean I attend nutrition interview the patients that have have shared their success with Gerson mmm-hmm but yeah diet and nutrition turkey and both of those protocols don\'t they yeah yes pretty much in a Japan to know what is the typical perspective of a Japanese doctor here mmm-hmm about the impact that nutrition can have on cancer treatment just a regular doctor\'s yeah the normal doctors I believe you know they they began to know about it but medical system does don\'t allow them to work on the nutrition I think just like the US but about a lot of a lot of Japanese medical doctors becoming aware of that I believe yeah so now it\'s changing in Japan well that was so fun to get to see that footage and I can\'t wait to see the final cut when it\'s through Japan has a lot to offer clearly and next we want to take you to Taiwan [Music] did you did you learn much about nutrition in medical school in the Western program nutrition no but not about the herbal medicine herbal medicine yes because the herbal medicine is the central about a Chinese medicine so the so the Western medical school in China teach herbal medicine yes okay because we put pain much time to learn about the earth because the herb in Chinese society nicing herb food together okay combined food come by or herbs as the everyday diet so the how the earth order food inference patient or inference normal subject or hair structure as well as a very common base or common knowledge okay so the the medical students that get out of get the education in China on the it would be considered Western medicine they\'re still taught about herbs in China which is very interesting it\'s giving very different than you a very different because in west medicine we think there are many different nutrition component in the food but in Chinese or in our culture we don\'t think so we think list food how this work an inference people about different thinking process or different point of view because in Western medicine this folks are particle or molecular so what the component or the compound inside a food is very important but in Chinese or Chinese culture we don\'t talk about the particle we talk about a wave just like light there are a very long history and argument about what is right his right is particle away from a Newton to n stand then to quantum mechanics then they finally sinks right is both particle and wave but nowadays the China medicine in the worst medicine argue every day just like in light China medicine think the medical fear is way but in West medicine the force on particle the different part of you so in China medicine all over the Sutan over a doctor like me with this way of thinking to talk about the nutrition the food the earth and the treatment they combine together so just like me integration over the Chinese and the Western medicine well used to the post view particle view and wave of you it was really cool going to Taiwan right after Japan those were the two countries that we visited that we actually had to get translators for everyone because they don\'t speak English primarily in those countries so Taiwan was great and then after we left Taiwan we flew over to Manila Philippines and so this next segment that you\'re going to see is some of the activities that we got to participate there in Manila so check it out [Music] initially what what do you believe that it is that sets the Philippines apart what what is unique here about the approach to cancer oh okay we do have what we call traditional medicine and I suppose you know that each place has something that\'s different from them and so that is really inculcated with us we usually go to to our elders who believe in what we call helots or our native healers and when I was younger we did we didn\'t go to doctors we went to all these people that were not doctors and so that is still in our in our genes and in our history but you know modern medicine has script crept into to the lifestyle may they think it\'s easier they think it\'s the best but we do have I think we\'re the only country or one of the countries that has a law we call it the Tamil law traditional and alternative medicine Act which mandated that the government study all of these traditional modalities and standardize them so we\'re very lucky to have that so the Tamil law here traditional traditional and alternative medicine as okay yeah that basically says that you can study everything you can study all of the traditional things and you can get certified for doing that and it\'s gonna be legal so it\'s not the the I guess the word traditional has been kind of changed to right because traditional medicine really is the herbs and they eat the traditional forms of healing are the things that have been here for traditions right claw isn\'t yet really traditional that\'s tradition so that\'s part of it but we do have some things that are unique like we have soup which is like a sauna but just you know using herbs and hot water and a cloth around you this is really the expert of doctormick Cuero and he would he can he can really tell us all about that then we have of course the Vento\'s we have our own kind of healer you know our massage then we have all the herbs of course and then we have manipulations that\'s like the equivalent of a chiropractor they\'re so good they just take your pulse and they say okay it\'s your lungs or it\'s your brain or whatever so they\'re they\'re excellent and we do have that and they\'re now being grouped together or you know their practices are standardized but there\'s still a difficulty because they don\'t just teach it to everyone they teach it to whoever they think is blessed to learn the knowledge it\'s very much like the Indians in the America they just you know know that healers there Wow more great information from the Philippines I can\'t wait to see the kind of cut of that one too I\'m intrigued I know that you are out there too so the next place through Asia that you got to go and visit and have fun well I was at home in Singapore let\'s take a sneak peek at Singapore [Music] what\'s the best ways to prevent cancer to get that knowledge so because you don\'t have to listen to get the right knowledge people may give you a lot of information not to eat is not to eat that but you must ask why okay as I talk to my cell of course as a Christian I believe that nature its cost provision is a healing so we found a healing in the nature there is something I feel a bit strange you know we are creative we are biological or biologically we are all the south and yet nutrients okay so when I cancer patient suffer and first thing is they need nutrients you know they are not the efficiency of chemo we are deficient of nutrients so first when you get a sufficient nutrient a party has a system that can heal this is in your system we call you it so we cannot do anything to sacrifice our new system just for the sake of cheating any things you know so I finally this is important so no matter what you do keep your immune system intact family and have a good chance to fight cancer chronic illnesses even pipe epics hypertension\'s yeah can be reversed you know we are taught you know happy tension diabetics or this incurable disease we have to take medicine for life but to me is a liar you know I was taught I was being rushed but I saw my patients getting better and we must I\'m not cheating they\'re diabetic the hypertension but somehow when they have cancer they change your diet they just change your lifestyle the pressure just dropped I never asked them to stop because they take the high potential their kind of side effects so they have to stop it\'s the fair doctor who put that on I said to his fault eventually their cure yeah Singapore was amazing there\'s some brilliant medical doctors there got a lot of great footage stuff that you\'re gonna really enjoy seeing once you see the next documentary that we produce and and after Singapore we just had a really short flight up to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia which is less than an hour from Singapore Singapore is actually adjacent to Malaysia so we flew up to Malaysia and you get a chance to see some of what we experienced right now you so dr. Vijay we just taught to talk to dr. Selvam and one of the things that he mentioned was that chemotherapy can actually enrich cancer stem cells do you have any idea why because I\'ve heard that before I\'ve read I\'ve read scientific literature that it does that but I don\'t understand how I think cells a by design are able to withstand various insults and they are designed to deal with poisons we are exposed to poisons all the time and we have built pretty robust the stem cells are very robust whether they are normal stem cells or cancer stem cells we see this with chemotherapy and radiotherapy although there are such toxic chemicals the chemotherapy the it kills a lot of actively dividing cells but yet we still have enough cancer stem cell reserve to real heal repair and regenerate at normal tissues cancer stem cells behave pretty much in the same way they have internal mechanisms and xym systems that can disable chemotherapy they also have mechanisms where they can pump out this chemotherapy out of their cells so there you are you know chemotherapy gets to the cancer stem cells but they\'re just you know shooing them away Oh neutralizing them by unique metabolic pathways and as we continuously expose them to chemotherapy they become resistant to this and one of the reasons why chemotherapy can become a problem after working so well initially is the development of resistance that\'s a great explanation that that explains why cancer comes back after a chemo therapies frequently because you killed a lot of the cancer but she didn\'t kill enough of the stem cells so that it couldn\'t regenerate the cancer absolutely because the weak chemotherapy works it\'s it is targeting actively dividing cells themselves generally dominant until they are called into action until you know certain signals proliferate them and traffic them to where there is damage so they remain dominant so dormant cells are not you know affected by the chemotherapy because they are designed to target actively dividing DNA some more great information coming to you from Malaysia that\'s just a sneak peek so much more to come so stay tuned we\'ve got more information we\'ll let you know when the final cut is done and ready for you to watch you don\'t want to miss a thing be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel if you haven\'t already so that you can get all the good updates follow us on Facebook we\'re on Twitter and on Instagram and of course we\'ve got our website the truth about cancer com so after malaysia ty got to take our wonderful crew including my son to thailand so let\'s go there now [Music] [Music] what I\'ve learned is it\'s and and I think anyone who works with cancer and anyone who\'s had cancer knows this to be a fundamental truth it\'s not hard to get rid of cancer the hard part is keeping it done I mean I can tell you how what percentage of patients come to us it\'s the third fourth time they\'ve had it right and that\'s that\'s the problem and it comes back with a vengeance so really what we do is we help people stop making cancer if you don\'t stop making cancer it\'s irrelevant how good anyone is at getting rid of it because it\'ll be back right and in the end in the analogy I give to people that they they get is if you had lung cancer and you were smoking and I didn\'t tell you to quit smoking would I be a good doctor would I be giving you the best advice now suppose you quit because they say to me hey Doc how long do I have to eat this way what so how long should I stop smoking well as long as you want to breathe that\'s a good that\'s a good way to look at it lifestyle change it\'s a lifestyle change so we have to change your lifestyle so what are we talking about really we\'re talking about our psycho-emotional spiritual life which is really really what Chan because even people come to an environment like this it\'s beautiful they change they go back to their home and they get back into the same dynamics you know if they had in their just rest and they go right back yeah so no matter what so that\'s why we always encourage family to come with that we want family to come and we want the whole family to understand why this is necessary and instead of having side effects we have side benefits mm-hmm like oh yeah my my doubt is gone too and oh yeah yeah I don\'t longer have chest pain when I eat you know and love oh so we have these side benefits of joy and energy and I sleep better and all these sort of things and so I tell the family members it\'s called secondhand health instead of secondhand smoke we have secondhand healthier so anyway it\'s this environment it\'s peaceful the type people are just very respectful honoring you that whole thing and then you go down to the beach and you just you know you get to commune with nature with God you know and that to me it\'s better medicine than anything we put in IVs you know cuz we can put them in the IVs and we might we can put in that power of a chemo use i PT kill that tumor six months later nine months later what do we got going so that\'s the thing so we have to change inside so we use meditation we use for people they get stuck with the word meditation I just you know learning how to turn the mind off learning how to silence the the madman in all of us how do you turn it off and how to de-stress and relax and all that so I think the best medicine we have here in Phuket is boot camp so as you can see Thailand was amazing we got a chance to go to Phuket Thailand and then Bangkok and interview some brilliant doctors one of the interesting things about Thailand is that after Thailand we were going to go to India but we had we couldn\'t get into India because of our visa situation and so we did interview multiple doctors from India while we were in Thailand they just had to fly to Bangkok and so that\'s an interesting little twist in the story is that they had to fly there we did hire another film crew that was able to film the Indian doctors in their natural habitat back in India right and if there are different clinics and interviewed some patients so that will be included but we had to interview the actual doctors personally in Bangkok Thailand [Music] [Music] patient that I saw of my low suppression we\'re in the bone marrow suppression and he was severely anemic and he had a very interesting story time he had a story but he wouldn\'t react to a situation so in the family whatever problems that the family faced his wife used to work and his son used to work and if the wife if his wife would share this is the problem this is the problem he would present a very indifferent attitude to the whole situation it might look as if he didn\'t care but it was an indifference throughout his life so I died I asked him I said weren\'t you aware of the situation the family faced and this is very important when I talk about integration integration in a patient integration in family setting and that\'s why in malignancy in cancer a family doctor is very important I still have patients die who leave a super speciality hospital with complex report of malignancy and they stand outside the door of the hospital and give me a call and the family physician doc is a malignant doc is a benign they want they want the statement of a family doctor that\'s why family medicine is very important in India we make it a great deal of effort to preserve this concept of family medicine so this gentleman was indifferent and this state of indifference was understood and he was prescribed a homeopathic remedy along with mistletoe and after this case got cured I was invited to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2013 to share these stories and it was a unique experience for me to present my work of torch patterns in cancer patient few years before the cancer and the malignancy develops what are the thought patterns what is the mind-body connection what is it and in every physician it is the duty of every physician to find out the mind and the body and the spirit to look at efficient that\'s important so that was it for the for our travels it was really amazing and we can\'t wait for you to see the final cut which will be next spring we\'re gonna release it in April but we were talking about India one of the interesting things about India is that a couple years ago three years ago there was an article that came out that I specifically remember and it was how that there\'s these outbreaks of of non paralytic polio oh yeah in India and they all started happening about the time that they started getting the polio vaccine they were gonna be on paralytic polio and so that was an interesting thing about what happened with polio we\'ll give you a little bit of a history lesson here and then we\'ll get to this article that we wanted to talk about real briefly was it back in the the mid 50s when the the oral polio vaccine was introduced in July of 1955 I think it was the CDC changed the definition of what polio was so it was much harder to qualify as polio so it looked like polio rates went down but the reality is whether they had introduced a vaccine there or not polio rates would have gone down because it was much harder to qualify as polio that\'s kind of what they did with in India a couple years ago they said this is not really polio this is acute flaccid paralysis so they changed the definition of polio they didn\'t say it was polio at least words like these new diseases and the reality is we know we\'ve seen the facts that these the polio vaccine was was injected in these populations in mass scale and these children started getting sick and started having symptoms of non paralytic polio which is still polio but it\'s just if there\'s not paralysis that\'s associated with it they had these other symptoms there like well that couldn\'t have been from the vaccine the polio vaccine when we know that the the the very inventor of the of the oral polio vaccine Jonas Salk testified before Congress in 1977 that every case of polio for the last 20 years was most likely caused by the vaccine so what does that have to do with this article honey you want to talk about this very very sad article about the in Pakistan yeah the headline reads Pakistan three infants died after receiving polio vaccine that\'s just sad that that title says it all really we\'re killing our kids with the vaccines yeah it says three infants aged one month to one-year-old are reported to have died in Sheheen Muslim Tower in Peshawar Pakistan after receiving the inactivated polio vaccine family members said that the health of the children gradually deteriorated after being injected with the vaccine news report state that five other children were also adversely affected after getting the polio shot but I\'m sure that the parents were just imagining this right they would they would say oh that had nothing to the vaccine you\'re just imagining the fact that your child\'s stake or it\'s a psychosomatic or maybe it\'s just for the greater good those parents are probably saying well we know this was for the greater good if one person dies from a vaccine it\'s not good it\'s not good actually for that family right especially for those parents and it\'s it\'s I say that it you know the families are devastated but when we hear so many of the so much of the time on our social networks or whatever we get response in and comments by people that say well you know that\'s just for the greater good some have to be sacrificed says who would they want to be sacrificed would they want their mothers to be sacrificed or their children I don\'t think so it\'s it\'s okay that to kill people unless it\'s your family well to us it\'s not okay to kill anybody we care about all of you out there it\'s not it\'s not right there\'s got to be a better way yeah and so I think that the takeaway from this is just remember vaccines have not been proven to be safe or effective vaccines are damaging you might think that the risks outweigh the benefits or you might think the benefits outweigh the risks but shouldn\'t you be educated on them either way so that you can make it a good choice right for you or your family that\'s all we want is for parents to be told both sides of the coin and this is not an isolated case this is not just well this just happened once it happens all the time at the end of the article in March 2018 three children died in Pakistan after getting the measles vaccine same month two children Todd died in India following the pentavalent vaccine which is diphtheria pertussis tetanus and Hep B and the hip and then in January 2018 a baby in Kenya died after receiving the measles vaccine a dream these are just a drop in the bucket compared to the actual numbers we have Bill Gates going into countries and vaccinating people that are starving homeless people that don\'t have access to the media that don\'t have access to attorneys that don\'t have access to official doctors to make reports saying my child died after this vaccine so the numbers are so far higher than it even reported yeah but the numbers that we do know is that in the United States alone in the last 30 years 3.7 billion dollars have been paid out to families of damaged children from vaccines and even though even that is just that\'s a bright new the ones that went to court and those are the ones that want improved that they\'re the person was vaccine damaged or killed by vaccines how many people have been damaged I have a friend that her six-month-old got a six week old baby got vaccinated and days later that the baby screamed until the baby was dead this mother thinks she was at fault here because she let the baby cry and that\'s heartbreaking she was not at fault babies cry I mean oh they cry themselves to sleep sleep but they don\'t cry themselves to death so how many parents have lost children unknowingly to the vaccine damage yep and again our position is that we want we don\'t want to force you to vaccinate or not to vaccinate we have our own position we just want you to be educated so that you can make a decision and the problem that we have with the current medical system the way that it\'s that it\'s set up is that parents are losing that right to choose whether or not they vaccinate they\'re being forced to vaccinate it and if you force medicine on someone it\'s gunpoint medicine as Mike Adams calls it and if lost the freedom to choose we\'re just about the freedom to make a good choice for you and your family and that\'s why we do what we do that\'s what we\'re trying to educate you and so hopefully you\'ve enjoyed the trip to Asia with us this episode of global health news and hopefully you\'ve become a little bit enraged about what\'s going on with with a lack of education about vaccines especially in these what we think of as third world countries where apparently the vaccine companies don\'t think they\'re near as important as the P that are in first world countries and so they\'re not educated at all about vaccines so we just hope that this has been beneficial for you yeah thank

Kelly William Kelly he\'s his therapy was amazing the mostly diet and nutrition and some you know other other stuff of detoxification but their way you know what quite well yeah Gerson Therapy is primarily juicing many many many times a day right I think they juice 13 times a day those cattle juice on vegetable juice right but it what\'s very very I believe yeah yeah yeah diet is very key I mean I attend nutrition interview the patients that have have shared their success with Gerson mmm-hmm but yeah diet and nutrition turkey and both of those protocols don\'t they yeah yes pretty much in a Japan to know what is the typical perspective of a Japanese doctor here mmm-hmm about the impact that nutrition can have on cancer treatment just a regular doctor\'s yeah the normal doctors I believe you know they they began to know about it but medical system does don\'t allow them to work on the nutrition I think just like the US but about a lot of a lot of Japanese medical doctors becoming aware of that I believe yeah so now it\'s changing in Japan well that was so fun to get to see that footage and I can\'t wait to see the final cut when it\'s through Japan has a lot to offer clearly and next we want to take you to Taiwan [Music] did you did you learn much about nutrition in medical school in the Western program nutrition no but not about the herbal medicine herbal medicine yes because the herbal medicine is the central about a Chinese medicine so the so the Western medical school in China teach herbal medicine yes okay because we put pain much time to learn about the earth because the herb in Chinese society nicing herb food together okay combined food come by or herbs as the everyday diet so the how the earth order food inference patient or inference normal subject or hair structure as well as a very common base or common knowledge okay so the the medical students that get out of get the education in China on the it would be considered Western medicine they\'re still taught about herbs in China which is very interesting it\'s giving very different than you a very different because in west medicine we think there are many different nutrition component in the food but in Chinese or in our culture we don\'t think so we think list food how this work an inference people about different thinking process or different point of view because in Western medicine this folks are particle or molecular so what the component or the compound inside a food is very important but in Chinese or Chinese culture we don\'t talk about the particle we talk about a wave just like light there are a very long history and argument about what is right his right is particle away from a Newton to n stand then to quantum mechanics then they finally sinks right is both particle and wave but nowadays the China medicine in the worst medicine argue every day just like in light China medicine think the medical fear is way but in West medicine the force on particle the different part of you so in China medicine all over the Sutan over a doctor like me with this way of thinking to talk about the nutrition the food the earth and the treatment they combine together so just like me integration over the Chinese and the Western medicine well used to the post view particle view and wave of you it was really cool going to Taiwan right after Japan those were the two countries that we visited that we actually had to get translators for everyone because they don\'t speak English primarily in those countries so Taiwan was great and then after we left Taiwan we flew over to Manila Philippines and so this next segment that you\'re going to see is some of the activities that we got to participate there in Manila so check it out [Music] initially what what do you believe that it is that sets the Philippines apart what what is unique here about the approach to cancer oh okay we do have what we call traditional medicine and I suppose you know that each place has something that\'s different from them and so that is really inculcated with us we usually go to to our elders who believe in what we call helots or our native healers and when I was younger we did we didn\'t go to doctors we went to all these people that were not doctors and so that is still in our in our genes and in our history but you know modern medicine has script crept into to the lifestyle may they think it\'s easier they think it\'s the best but we do have I think we\'re the only country or one of the countries that has a law we call it the Tamil law traditional and alternative medicine Act which mandated that the government study all of these traditional modalities and standardize them so we\'re very lucky to have that so the Tamil law here traditional traditional and alternative medicine as okay yeah that basically says that you can study everything you can study all of the traditional things and you can get certified for doing that and it\'s gonna be legal so it\'s not the the I guess the word traditional has been kind of changed to right because traditional medicine really is the herbs and they eat the traditional forms of healing are the things that have been here for traditions right claw isn\'t yet really traditional that\'s tradition so that\'s part of it but we do have some things that are unique like we have soup which is like a sauna but just you know using herbs and hot water and a cloth around you this is really the expert of doctormick Cuero and he would he can he can really tell us all about that then we have of course the Vento\'s we have our own kind of healer you know our massage then we have all the herbs of course and then we have manipulations that\'s like the equivalent of a chiropractor they\'re so good they just take your pulse and they say okay it\'s your lungs or it\'s your brain or whatever so they\'re they\'re excellent and we do have that and they\'re now being grouped together or you know their practices are standardized but there\'s still a difficulty because they don\'t just teach it to everyone they teach it to whoever they think is blessed to learn the knowledge it\'s very much like the Indians in the America they just you know know that healers there Wow more great information from the Philippines I can\'t wait to see the kind of cut of that one too I\'m intrigued I know that you are out there too so the next place through Asia that you got to go and visit and have fun well I was at home in Singapore let\'s take a sneak peek at Singapore [Music] what\'s the best ways to prevent cancer to get that knowledge so because you don\'t have to listen to get the right knowledge people may give you a lot of information not to eat is not to eat that but you must ask why okay as I talk to my cell of course as a Christian I believe that nature its cost provision is a healing so we found a healing in the nature there is something I feel a bit strange you know we are creative we are biological or biologically we are all the south and yet nutrients okay so when I cancer patient suffer and first thing is they need nutrients you know they are not the efficiency of chemo we are deficient of nutrients so first when you get a sufficient nutrient a party has a system that can heal this is in your system we call you it so we cannot do anything to sacrifice our new system just for the sake of cheating any things you know so I finally this is important so no matter what you do keep your immune system intact family and have a good chance to fight cancer chronic illnesses even pipe epics hypertension\'s yeah can be reversed you know we are taught you know happy tension diabetics or this incurable disease we have to take medicine for life but to me is a liar you know I was taught I was being rushed but I saw my patients getting better and we must I\'m not cheating they\'re diabetic the hypertension but somehow when they have cancer they change your diet they just change your lifestyle the pressure just dropped I never asked them to stop because they take the high potential their kind of side effects so they have to stop it\'s the fair doctor who put that on I said to his fault eventually their cure yeah Singapore was amazing there\'s some brilliant medical doctors there got a lot of great footage stuff that you\'re gonna really enjoy seeing once you see the next documentary that we produce and and after Singapore we just had a really short flight up to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia which is less than an hour from Singapore Singapore is actually adjacent to Malaysia so we flew up to Malaysia and you get a chance to see some of what we experienced right now you so dr. Vijay we just taught to talk to dr. Selvam and one of the things that he mentioned was that chemotherapy can actually enrich cancer stem cells do you have any idea why because I\'ve heard that before I\'ve read I\'ve read scientific literature that it does that but I don\'t understand how I think cells a by design are able to withstand various insults and they are designed to deal with poisons we are exposed to poisons all the time and we have built pretty robust the stem cells are very robust whether they are normal stem cells or cancer stem cells we see this with chemotherapy and radiotherapy although there are such toxic chemicals the chemotherapy the it kills a lot of actively dividing cells but yet we still have enough cancer stem cell reserve to real heal repair and regenerate at normal tissues cancer stem cells behave pretty much in the same way they have internal mechanisms and xym systems that can disable chemotherapy they also have mechanisms where they can pump out this chemotherapy out of their cells so there you are you know chemotherapy gets to the cancer stem cells but they\'re just you know shooing them away Oh neutralizing them by unique metabolic pathways and as we continuously expose them to chemotherapy they become resistant to this and one of the reasons why chemotherapy can become a problem after working so well initially is the development of resistance that\'s a great explanation that that explains why cancer comes back after a chemo therapies frequently because you killed a lot of the cancer but she didn\'t kill enough of the stem cells so that it couldn\'t regenerate the cancer absolutely because the weak chemotherapy works it\'s it is targeting actively dividing cells themselves generally dominant until they are called into action until you know certain signals proliferate them and traffic them to where there is damage so they remain dominant so dormant cells are not you know affected by the chemotherapy because they are designed to target actively dividing DNA some more great information coming to you from Malaysia that\'s just a sneak peek so much more to come so stay tuned we\'ve got more information we\'ll let you know when the final cut is done and ready for you to watch you don\'t want to miss a thing be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel if you haven\'t already so that you can get all the good updates follow us on Facebook we\'re on Twitter and on Instagram and of course we\'ve got our website the truth about cancer com so after malaysia ty got to take our wonderful crew including my son to thailand so let\'s go there now [Music] [Music] what I\'ve learned is it\'s and and I think anyone who works with cancer and anyone who\'s had cancer knows this to be a fundamental truth it\'s not hard to get rid of cancer the hard part is keeping it done I mean I can tell you how what percentage of patients come to us it\'s the third fourth time they\'ve had it right and that\'s that\'s the problem and it comes back with a vengeance so really what we do is we help people stop making cancer if you don\'t stop making cancer it\'s irrelevant how good anyone is at getting rid of it because it\'ll be back right and in the end in the analogy I give to people that they they get is if you had lung cancer and you were smoking and I didn\'t tell you to quit smoking would I be a good doctor would I be giving you the best advice now suppose you quit because they say to me hey Doc how long do I have to eat this way what so how long should I stop smoking well as long as you want to breathe that\'s a good that\'s a good way to look at it lifestyle change it\'s a lifestyle change so we have to change your lifestyle so what are we talking about really we\'re talking about our psycho-emotional spiritual life which is really really what Chan because even people come to an environment like this it\'s beautiful they change they go back to their home and they get back into the same dynamics you know if they had in their just rest and they go right back yeah so no matter what so that\'s why we always encourage family to come with that we want family to come and we want the whole family to understand why this is necessary and instead of having side effects we have side benefits mm-hmm like oh yeah my my doubt is gone too and oh yeah yeah I don\'t longer have chest pain when I eat you know and love oh so we have these side benefits of joy and energy and I sleep better and all these sort of things and so I tell the family members it\'s called secondhand health instead of secondhand smoke we have secondhand healthier so anyway it\'s this environment it\'s peaceful the type people are just very respectful honoring you that whole thing and then you go down to the beach and you just you know you get to commune with nature with God you know and that to me it\'s better medicine than anything we put in IVs you know cuz we can put them in the IVs and we might we can put in that power of a chemo use i PT kill that tumor six months later nine months later what do we got going so that\'s the thing so we have to change inside so we use meditation we use for people they get stuck with the word meditation I just you know learning how to turn the mind off learning how to silence the the madman in all of us how do you turn it off and how to de-stress and relax and all that so I think the best medicine we have here in Phuket is boot camp so as you can see Thailand was amazing we got a chance to go to Phuket Thailand and then Bangkok and interview some brilliant doctors one of the interesting things about Thailand is that after Thailand we were going to go to India but we had we couldn\'t get into India because of our visa situation and so we did interview multiple doctors from India while we were in Thailand they just had to fly to Bangkok and so that\'s an interesting little twist in the story is that they had to fly there we did hire another film crew that was able to film the Indian doctors in their natural habitat back in India right and if there are different clinics and interviewed some patients so that will be included but we had to interview the actual doctors personally in Bangkok Thailand [Music] [Music] patient that I saw of my low suppression we\'re in the bone marrow suppression and he was severely anemic and he had a very interesting story time he had a story but he wouldn\'t react to a situation so in the family whatever problems that the family faced his wife used to work and his son used to work and if the wife if his wife would share this is the problem this is the problem he would present a very indifferent attitude to the whole situation it might look as if he didn\'t care but it was an indifference throughout his life so I died I asked him I said weren\'t you aware of the situation the family faced and this is very important when I talk about integration integration in a patient integration in family setting and that\'s why in malignancy in cancer a family doctor is very important I still have patients die who leave a super speciality hospital with complex report of malignancy and they stand outside the door of the hospital and give me a call and the family physician doc is a malignant doc is a benign they want they want the statement of a family doctor that\'s why family medicine is very important in India we make it a great deal of effort to preserve this concept of family medicine so this gentleman was indifferent and this state of indifference was understood and he was prescribed a homeopathic remedy along with mistletoe and after this case got cured I was invited to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2013 to share these stories and it was a unique experience for me to present my work of torch patterns in cancer patient few years before the cancer and the malignancy develops what are the thought patterns what is the mind-body connection what is it and in every physician it is the duty of every physician to find out the mind and the body and the spirit to look at efficient that\'s important so that was it for the for our travels it was really amazing and we can\'t wait for you to see the final cut which will be next spring we\'re gonna release it in April but we were talking about India one of the interesting things about India is that a couple years ago three years ago there was an article that came out that I specifically remember and it was how that there\'s these outbreaks of of non paralytic polio oh yeah in India and they all started happening about the time that they

that you can make it a good choice right for you or your family that\'s all we want is for parents to be told both sides of the coin and this is not an isolated case this is not just well this just happened once it happens all the time at the end of the article in March 2018 three children died in Pakistan after getting the measles vaccine same month two children Todd died in India following the pentavalent vaccine which is diphtheria pertussis tetanus and Hep B and the hip and then in January 2018 a baby in Kenya died after receiving the measles vaccine a dream these are just a drop in the bucket compared to the actual numbers we have Bill Gates going into countries and vaccinating people that are starving homeless people that don\'t have access to the media that don\'t have access to

damage yep and again our position is that we want we don\'t want to force you to vaccinate or not to vaccinate we have our own position we just want you to be educated so that you can make a decision and the problem that we have with the current medical system the way that it\'s that it\'s set up is that parents are losing that right to choose whether or not they vaccinate they\'re being forced to vaccinate it and if you force medicine on someone it\'s gunpoint medicine as Mike Adams calls it and if lost the freedom to choose we\'re just about the freedom to make a good choice for you and your family and that\'s why we do what we do that\'s what we\'re trying to educate you and so hopefully you\'ve enjoyed the trip to Asia with us this episode of global health news and hopefully you\'ve become a little bit enraged about what\'s going on with with a lack of education about vaccines especially in these what we think of as third world countries where apparently the vaccine companies don\'t think they\'re near as important as the P that are in first world countries and so they\'re not educated at all about vaccines so we just hope that this has been beneficial for you yeah thank

and we have Jason Larson let me see if I got all your titles here we\'ve got you\'re an RN your case manager you work in the ER and let\'s see in the ICU and you do inpatient care is there anything else you want to throw out there for everyone basically he\'s an expert and a lot of things over there at the hospital today we\'re going to be talking about all kinds of safety related stuff especially for this Memorial Day weekend the summer and life in general thank you for joining us we\'re gonna go ahead and roll the intro and see you guys in just a second if I can find it [Music] all right now that we have that out of the way today we\'re here to talk about what summer safety is that what was that what we\'re here for absolutely that\'s my understanding all right well we I have some questions for you guys here I know you guys have a lot of things that you want to talk about what is your biggest concern with summertime a safety oh yeah I know you\'ve got to pick one well if you got to pick one what is the number one thing that you think everybody should be aware of and be safe with out there whether it\'s you know hydration or accidents or what do you think is the number one thing I mean you guys are in a hospital what do you have come in most aggression probably covers them widest hydration there all right although there\'s a lot of concerns hydration is a big one hydration is a big one probably easiest to fix that make sense it needs used to prevent really and you don\'t have to be a clinician to be able to hydrate drink the water it\'s just a better worth of me grant water as we all have our water here we have our water a lot of things that happen out here in Paige Paige America Lake Powell that we can\'t stop we can\'t stop some accidents but we can stop the United Russia ship for the most part a little good planning and making sure that when you\'re out there you\'re staying adequately hydrated what is adequately hydrated mm-hmm I know you know there\'s a lot of different statistics out there there\'s this there\'s that what\'s like a good rule of thumb so that you can stay hydrated out there this may not be official but I\'ll throw this out there if you were to take your body weight and times of I like 70% okay and then drink that many ounces of water okay oh wow she\'s got something I can\'t see what it does oh yes Jason needs to speak up a bit all right look I\'m too quiet so say will say take 70% of your body weight in pounds in pounds drink that many ounces what if somebody is out there there 70% of what yeah you know well with with a few of highly carbonated adult beverages sometimes people get to that point okay a great rule of thumb that I know coaches talk about all the time in summer sports is if your urine is clear you\'re hydrated it\'s not you\'re not if you\'re feeling thirsty you\'ve already begun the dehydration process okay all right yeah if you\'re thirsty it\'s too late you should have been drinking already - go ahead and make sure it\'s never too late but it\'s time now to start drinking water yes I like to tell people you know barring any other medical conditions like diabetes or something like that they\'re gonna uh if you\'re gonna be out there throw some sports drink in every you know maybe alternate water gatorade gets an electrolyte we have that people come in who have been absolutely on the ball hydrating they\'ve drunk you know seven liters of water that day and then they come in and they\'ve depleted their sodium and I love their electrolytes and so they\'re you can overdo it but keep things balanced make sure you\'re not thirsty you\'re you\'re drinking throughout the day out there why okay so I have a here\'s an off-the-wall question for has to do with them let\'s see what you guys got here so we\'re talking about electrolytes and we\'re not talking about the idiocracy kind where you know electrolytes it\'s what plants crave what exactly does an electrolyte do that\'s so important like if you drink say for instance people are drinking distilled water or like you were talking about they drink tons and tons of water and flush the electrolytes out of their system well what is an electrolyte and why is it so important and you know I mean that you don\'t want to drink sports drinks all of the time why is it important for you to have that in your system what does it do well electrolytes are what all of our neurons all the electrical system in your body what makes your heart beat what makes your nerve send a message from your brain your fingers to move that all has to do with electrolyte exchange the exchange of calcium sodium potassium and all those things need to stay you know in the right balance so you don\'t gotta make the body work the way it needs to your body will regulate that to a point okay you you can put yourself in situations where you\'ll exhaust the capacity of your body to adapt okay like sweating it all out you sweating it all but you know whatever not drinking enough getting getting too hot and even your body\'s ability to regulate temperature has its limits okay well that makes sense let\'s see okay so one of the things I wanted to ask you guys about is what is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke so we\'ve got the experts Daisy award-winning are in right here so so heat stroke means we just mentioned this a little bit you\'ve you\'ve exceeded your body\'s capacity to adjust and regulate its own temperature okay you\'re you\'re greater than 40 degrees centigrade that\'s that\'s what we measure temperature in most the time somebody comes in to actually heat stroke they\'re they\'re not sweating anymore they have so they max s-stop everything out and they\'re no longer able to cool themselves and that\'s an emergency situation they may lose consciousness at that point they can a lot of bad things can happen so there\'s like the opposite of hypothermia where you can\'t warm myself up if you\'re hyper 30 hyperthermia and you heat exhaust and then both these are kind of more late terms we\'d say hyperthermia technically but sure food exhaustion you\'re too hot but your body is still trying it\'s ready so not as severe of a situation but both of them are our severe you need hydration you need to cool down you need to minimize the exposure so if you\'re if you\'re sweating profusely and you\'re not feeling like you look cool down don\'t stay out there on the deck here okay get-get somewhere where you\'re out of the Sun keep covered up it\'s okay um if you\'re out on the lake and you need to cool down and you don\'t have access to indoors or AC get a t-shirt get wet wring it out a little bit put that on weight you know that\'s a good evaporative cooling can come out pretty quickly okay okay hydrate but most importantly these these type of things small things you\'re going to do out there are gonna be enough to buy you time to get in for medical treatment okay well that makes sense let\'s see what else do I have here okay so we\'ve got we let it it\'s called hyperthermia right hyperthermia heat stroke heat exhaustion what are the signs so other people can you know if someone is you know they have kids or one of their friends they\'re on a boat is it easy to spot somebody that is having problems with us are there signs to look out for so they can be like hey you need to pay attention what\'s going on you need to get in the shade you need to cool off something like that are there signs that people could easily pick out people say they\'re getting lightheaded they\'re feelingly see somebody stand up like whoa no I\'m not feeling too well if you see somebody he\'s just not that I can quite right if they\'re sweating a bunch if they\'re you know constant Fanning themselves I would say just in across the room look that\'d be the things I\'d be watching out for okay I would second Bryant\'s come in on the P if you\'re not peeing it\'s been all day long and you are peeing yeah all the weight don\'t think that\'s just a convenient all right make sure that your your your drinking your pinion taking with kiddos that\'s that\'s the number one thing to watch it you get a young kid out there make sure the therapy make sure that they\'re drinking eating their behaviour normally you know I would say with the kids they\'re sleeping a lot there are things mainly flushed you know those are all things that would be looking as a scientific maybe overexposure okay all right so get them in the shade train cool them all all right now that\'s for from an external point of view now what about okay so how can I monitor myself you know I a lot of people out there don\'t know you know if you haven\'t caught it from the website or anything this is a veteran owned and operated facility here I\'m actually a survival expert but a lot of people out there aren\'t I know what my limits are I know what to look out for but a lot of people don\'t what do you recommend okay so you said feeling light-headed and stuff if you\'re the one that\'s out there maybe you don\'t have somebody else or maybe you\'re just more aware what should you pay attention for what are the signs that you know like hey I need to really do something right now you know what should we be looking out for they go back to the P they\'re just go back to the P thing or production or thirst okay I\'m your own feeling perception now you know you feel like you\'re doing a gun if you feel hot you probably are okay alright pull yourself down get in some shape you summer backwards cool you mean to minimize exposure okay I know one of the things that we used to do when it get really really I mean you know smokin hot out there you know throwing 115 degrees one of the things that we used to do and I\'m actually curious because I know it works for me I don\'t know if there\'s a metal component to it or not but one of the things we used to do is okay so you\'ve got the shirt where you put it on when it\'s wet but one of the things that that we learned was actually to get something cold and evaporative that wraps right around here and drive some of your neck because it helps cool off the blood go into your head and there\'s actually products out there really so do I it\'s a great market line right now on the the cooling towels they sell them all across stage I have no doubt something yeah I\'m sure there\'s a lot of different products competing for that marketplace but there\'s probably something a rag or a towel or spare t-shirt or I mean virtually anything - so something like that would actually help and this is the way a swamp cooler works for LA you guys ought to have swamp coolers anytime you evaporate and you turn the liquid into a gas you\'re gonna cool it yeah if you ever pay attention to a spray King they got liquid in them they got gas in them you can warm that up in a in a sink of water shake it up and you will feel it get cool instantly okay we\'re like those cans of hairspray there when you start spraying them the whole can just artist a single and that\'s like you\'ll get from that what you\'re doing with that rag you\'re evaporating turning from a liquid to a gas you\'re evaporative cooling so yeah anywhere you can do it on your body you can do it on around your neck is there any I mean so that\'s what I was trying to bring up but is there any best way to do it or are you just trying to cool off no matter what I\'ve seen oh I said my old Scout masters would get a hat similar to yours he had a little thing that hung down on his butt he would get that wet in the river bring it out a little bit put it on his head constantly was to do that all day long that makes sense man I said cool so no I don\'t think so I don\'t think there\'s any specific algorithm you need to follow okay stay hydrated try to cool yourself off the best that you can you know if you have a fan or you have the ability to make it a little bit wet and cruising getting little wings being going against you that maybe help make sense all right we don\'t have a lot of trees here for shade that mean you might have noticed about when the Sun gets low you can find plenty of places though to in but rock is born Sun is warm to that rock so there\'s there\'s opportunities but trust yourself you\'re not feeling right start doing things they\'re doing yeah none of the people know where you\'re going to exit is that certainly helps have your cell phone with you I mean that could get pinged we you know people can be found because they have that cell phone it\'s that can be a life-saving device certainly and if you\'re on a hike and you\'re at the halfway point of your water you\'ve drank half of it your hikes it\'s time to turn around over it\'s just this yeah that makes sense well why take a chance there\'s so many things that we see are preventable I\'m just by a little bit of planning and you know thinking about interesting yourself a little bit okay that doesn\'t make sense and you were talking about the hack thing a lot of people that they\'re seen my hat I actually got this to help protect me when I was digging ditches out in the in the desert and it keeps my ears from getting burned keeps my neck from getting burned and it keeps the direct sunlight off of my head so it\'s a lot lot easier to do stuff and it doesn\'t cook your brain you\'ll be you\'ll be cooler immediately the other things use sunscreen okay there\'s aisles of that all across this communities president I\'m here absolutely it is so use sensation for you I have actually don\'t really answer this a lot of people that I\'ve talked to say that sunscreen expires and after six months or a year you should throw it away and buy new stuff do you know anything about that I would check the expiration date on the product itself okay the people who produce that okay obviously have to be able to know how long the effective ingredients are there okay and it\'ll be published on there so probably a great idea not to use expired sunscreen sorry if you put it if you talk about that much as an expired was all I have it then user yeah that\'s gonna be nothing absolutely absolutely let\'s go ahead and move on from the heat problems you know in the hydration now obviously being up here is a huge deal but we\'ve got all kinds of other problems up here it comes in let\'s let\'s start with critters you know what kind of critters do I need to worry about and if something happens with said critter what do you do what\'s your number one issue that you guys have at the hospital with critters with critters I think the things that get most people\'s attention the most people think about immediately is always gonna be around absolutely it\'s gonna be snakes I feel like me you\'re just terrified of snakes in general okay like a rattlesnake over here a rattle and I\'m double scared I guess okay but you know it\'s not the movies they don\'t jump out at you necessarily that would be a pretty doggone rare thing okay but when you get bit you know we just shared some things on our hospitals Facebook page about you know some from some of the medical directors at Banner Health mmm-hmm sharing you know there\'s there\'s a lot of things that people have done for a long don\'t capture the rattlesnake don\'t come the only one we don\'t need the rattlesnake when you come into the emergency department okay have you ever asked for a rattlesnake Jason nope not even know I think that\'s a good one don\'t uh don\'t try to suck the venom out okay what about those kids snakebite kits do you wanna speak to the snakebite kit there\'s a bunch of different kinds out there are any of them acceptable to use I\'m because officially I believe at the last guideline I heard that was that trying to suck the venom out wasn\'t really that effective but I\'m gonna defer to see I could have to look that up okay well that makes sense I mean I don\'t think it\'s gonna do a whole lot but number one thing you need to you need to focus on is getting to medical attention as quickly as possible that\'s most important thing well that was actually talking believe it or not to my dad I haven\'t seen him and I don\'t know probably eight years and we were we were having some old stories you know you\'re sitting there talking about things and when he was a kid he I think he said he was about 18 years old maybe maybe a little older than that he was living here in Arizona and he\'d go out on Jeep rows by himself he\'d go out for Weiland and he got out and he was probably 20 30 miles from the nearest highway and he decided he was gonna go exploring and climbed up this rock formation and part of the cliff and he got about halfway up to that and he threw his leg up without looking you know yeah right there and he put his leg on a rattlesnake and obviously you know if the rattlesnake bit him and he was saying you know it\'s not like the movies it\'s not like they bite and let go I had to pry that sucker off over there and then you know throw the snake away he\'s 20 miles out in the middle of nowhere he was at he was he had to use a tourniquet you know on and off trying to keep the thing but he had a CB radio in the Jeep and he was able to get ahold of someone on channel 9 and call an ambulance and they said they could meet him out on the highway and anyway he managed to be ok they got him you know they got out of the fiddle they got a mana venom and stuff but his legs swollen that was all black and it was really nasty what a snake kit maybe helping the situation like that or should they use the tourniquet method what you know I mean obviously getting medical attention is number one you know if you\'re out in the middle of nowhere what\'s the best procedure to do for a situation like that I might try to milk a little bit out there ready know right after that okay but I don\'t I guess said I\'m gonna I would have to look the answer that people do use a tourniquet well if you don\'t know how to apply those properly they can cause a lot more damage I\'d go with somebody I\'m going out by yourself yeah you know might feel very freeing and independent I mean who doesn\'t like a little a long time but you know when you\'re 20 miles away from civilization you are farther away you get when you\'re by yourself about the higher risk oh absolutely and you\'re doing it whereas if you had somebody to say hey look you drive this four-wheeler back and we\'re gonna use the CB we\'re using the cell phone we\'re gonna use whatever we can okay to contact people to have emergency personnel as close by as possible if you\'re on the National Park you utilize the National Park Service they have fantastic people yes they start rescuing we hear about that all the time we see that all the time I can imagine and in our local EMTs they\'re they\'re very well trained you know they know this piece well okay all right well that makes sense I mean you know there\'s a lot of different things I was just curious if you guys had any kind of you know even if you have the two people you could send somebody offer is there something specifically they should do I mean one of the things that mmm that we were to keep your heart rate down you know don\'t panic don\'t run don\'t walk do as little as you can so that it goes slower until you can get help does that make sense yeah I would just minimize your exertion as much as possible okay and if you have two people that way the other person goes out fighting okay and we\'ve got physicians and providers waiting to take care of you at the emergency department as well that\'s that\'s what we do all right so okay we\'ve gone through some of the critters what in this area up here other than rattlesnakes do you have to watch out for the other two venomous critters out there probably gonna be a bark scorpion or a black widow bark scorpion or a black widow okay yeah I don\'t like scorpions and I don\'t like snakes we had a freak event yeah I get into given somebody a scorpion especially you don\'t know what kind it was I would get in for evaluation the probably the same advice with the black widow or some people that don\'t have huge reactions to them but sometimes it can be really bad yeah it comes a little bit later it\'s not gonna happen right then and there at the bike typically I mean it may hurt a little bit but hours following we can get that pretty uncomfortable for some people so and black widow let\'s say that\'s a neurotoxin for black widows some reason for a scorpion oh is it okay I didn\'t know what\'s gonna just gonna ask that what kind of what kind of enema they have I know that\'s nasty but yeah they affect a pre synaptic cleft neuron and we talked about electrolytes earlier and they affect the electrolyte gated channels there okay why I didn\'t technique I learned something new today that\'s actually really interesting how about being I believe trigger multiple of the Black Widow venom sticks mostly to the calcium channels but it can cause your muscle contractions it can cause chest pain okay I\'ll have enough lactic reaction so it varies a lot depending as a person okay now I know we were talking a little bit earlier and you guys were we\'re mentioning something we\'re gonna bring it up because this is one of the big ones watching your kids oh yeah and we\'re both fathers and so all three of us are parents and you know don\'t go a full minute without knowing where your kids at and whether you\'re in the water by the water or you\'re on land maybe you\'re by your camper because all those things we\'re talking about children have a tendency to explore oh yeah quite naturally I mean that\'s that\'s a very natural instinct and so you know watching them run boats campers cars anywhere on the land you know we have we have cliffs here we know that and a lot of water that could result in bad outcomes and of course we can minimize that by keeping a close eye on our kids keep life preservers on yes they\'re out at all time always you know I\'m gonna go as far as to say if you\'re gonna have a kid out on Lake Powell probably best that they they at least are can swim and dog paddle with a life vest on my kids have these little I think they called puddle jumper it\'s like has little arm muscles and pants to a life preserver and it\'s a whatever class flotation device so have something like that there as much as Lake Powell is a totally a family friendly place and there\'s lots of great memories to be had that doesn\'t guarantee that he\'s safe it\'s actually one of the most dangerous lakes in the country statistically speaking you still have to take safety measures I mean there\'s some basic things you can do and to pray protect you and the people you care about and I think it\'s actually the law if you\'re under 16 and you\'re on the lake you need to be wearing a life jacket yes and we had unfortunately we were reported um I believe it was two weeks ago someone was out on the lake and they were in a houseboat and it was an older gentleman and he was trying to tie his boat up to his houseboat he had a bass boat he fell off and he drowned and died because he wasn\'t learning life preserver and something happened and he didn\'t make it but he could have been wearing a life jacket it\'d have been just climbing yeah so so it\'s you know that\'s tough we all want to have fun on the water of course that\'s why made they call it a recreation area yeah but you know we still have to you know to take those measures and you know I know the life vest might not be the most comfortable thing in our family the rule is or you\'re 18 great you\'re still wearing one make sense I\'m wearing one we\'re all wearing one why wouldn\'t we that\'s a really deep lake it takes an inch of water for Solana Jerome so it\'s just it\'s just not worth the risk complacency kills you might as well be safe let\'s go ready put it so anything you can do to prevent and minimize risk is worth doing that makes here\'s your safety out there is your responsibility although we have Park Service we have area ambulance we\'ve got some awesome people that that will go out there to help you that you can still be very far away and you can be in areas without cell phone reception and by the time help gets to you it may not be as fast as you as you think it might come so yeah unfortunately everybody hears about a a few bad outcomes that we have coming in off the lake or from the surrounding areas each year so be aware of your surroundings make sure that you plan and make sure you don\'t take unnecessary risks I would say one very easily modifiable risk factor one thing that makes any emergency worse is high speed okay now slow down slow down slow down that makes no need to you know to travel 50 60 70 miles an hour on the water and there\'s no need to take excessive risks you can still probably have almost as much fun as you were if you\'re not speeding all right guaranteed when an accident happened one way to make it I\'m gonna make any situation worse two ways yeah mixed in speed mixing alcohol yeah and your your situation is gonna lowers yes you can imagine so we\'ve covered some of the basics do you guys have anything specific you want to tell our audience about that good you want to just get the word out yeah I think we just hit our bullet points hydrate slow down you smart keep your eyes on your kids so those are the accidents nobody wants to happen so I think that we need to say we see 11,000 people a year in the emergency department just it a better page Hospital okay Wow as a lot of people it is a lot of people it and so as we look at that we be okay if those numbers were down a little bit because people were safer you know we\'re a community hospital that\'s why we exist we\'re here to take care of you know the people who live in our area who are visiting our area we want them to leave with photographs and memories and so if we can help them not have to visit the emergency department that\'s a great so prevent what do you know what the percentages is of preventable injuries you know like maybe it was hydration or other things of that nature I don\'t know define preventable sometimes you know it\'s so I don\'t have that broken okay well that\'s fine I just you know I mean obviously you guys have stuff that nobody can help you know you heart attack car accidents things like that I just come you know people don\'t doing maybe they were going too fast and not paying attention now we\'re live J and stuff we want to try and keep those you know if you guys are if you guys are out there pay attention to what you\'re doing you\'d be safe you want to end up in the emergency room well yeah we\'re open 24 365 and we are level four trauma center so we\'re certified with that so we have a general surgeon there 24 hours a day 365 days a year so we\'re prepared to intervene and help you but we just as soon you were just safe and didn\'t had a good time and we see everything from a flute to major major traumas that I know you\'ve reported on oh yes so we rather see the flu I don\'t blame you I don\'t blame you yeah let\'s try it let\'s try and have a safe weekend everybody is Memorial Day weekend it\'s supposed to be crazy up there they\'re gonna be people ever yeah I\'d say they\'d be hanging off the rafters but there\'s none out there so the dirty here yeah they are and there\'s more coming in I mean they\'re gonna moan all day I was your flu yeah yeah we were we were talking about that last night all of the all the national parks are just getting you know and lots of tourism so be safe out there have a great one thank you guys for joining us here with Bryan Keller and Jason Larson from banner page Hospital we appreciate you guys coming down thanks for inviting us for how to problem alright you guys

there if you were to take your body weight and times of I like 70% okay and then drink that many ounces of water okay oh wow she\'s got something I can\'t see what it does oh yes Jason needs to speak up a bit all right look I\'m too quiet so say will say take 70% of your body weight in pounds in pounds drink that many ounces what if somebody is out there there 70% of what yeah you know well with with a few of highly carbonated adult beverages sometimes people get to that point okay a great rule of thumb that I know coaches talk about all the time in summer sports is if your urine is clear you\'re hydrated it\'s not you\'re not if you\'re feeling thirsty you\'ve already begun the dehydration process okay all right yeah if you\'re thirsty it\'s too late you should have been drinking already - go ahead and make sure it\'s never too late but it\'s time now to start drinking water yes I like to tell people you know barring any other medical conditions like diabetes or something like that they\'re gonna uh if you\'re gonna be out there throw some sports drink in every you know maybe alternate water gatorade gets an electrolyte we have that people come in who have been absolutely on the ball hydrating they\'ve drunk you know seven liters of water that day and then they come in and they\'ve depleted their sodium and I love their electrolytes and so they\'re you can overdo it but keep things balanced make sure you\'re not thirsty you\'re you\'re drinking throughout the day out there why okay so I have a here\'s an off-the-wall question for has to do with them let\'s see what you guys got here so we\'re talking about electrolytes and we\'re not talking about the idiocracy kind where you know electrolytes it\'s what plants crave what exactly does an electrolyte do that\'s so important like if you drink say for instance people are drinking distilled water or like you were talking about they drink tons and tons of water and flush the electrolytes out of their system well what is an electrolyte and why is it so important and you know I mean that you don\'t want to drink sports drinks all of the time why is it important for you to have that in your system what does it do well electrolytes are what all of our neurons all the electrical system in your body what makes your heart beat what makes your nerve send a message from your brain your fingers to move that all has to do with electrolyte exchange the exchange of calcium sodium potassium and all those things need to stay you know in the right balance so you don\'t gotta make the body work the way it needs to your body will regulate that to a point okay you you can put yourself in situations where you\'ll exhaust the capacity of your body to adapt okay like sweating it all out you sweating it all but you know whatever not drinking enough getting getting too hot and even your body\'s ability to regulate temperature has its limits okay well that makes sense let\'s see okay so one of the things I wanted to ask you guys about is what is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke so we\'ve got the experts Daisy award-winning are in right here so so heat stroke means we just mentioned this a little bit you\'ve you\'ve exceeded your body\'s capacity to adjust and regulate its own temperature okay you\'re you\'re greater than 40 degrees centigrade that\'s that\'s what we measure temperature in most the time somebody comes in to actually heat stroke they\'re they\'re not sweating anymore they have so they max s-stop everything out and they\'re no longer able to cool themselves and that\'s an emergency situation they may lose consciousness at that point they can a lot of bad things can happen so there\'s like the opposite of hypothermia where you can\'t warm myself up if you\'re hyper 30 hyperthermia and you heat exhaust and then both these are kind of more late terms we\'d say hyperthermia technically but sure food exhaustion you\'re too hot but your body is still trying it\'s ready so not as severe of a situation but both of them are our severe you need hydration you need to cool down you need to minimize the exposure so if you\'re if you\'re sweating profusely and you\'re not feeling like you look cool down don\'t stay out there on the deck here okay get-get somewhere where you\'re out of the Sun keep covered up it\'s okay um if you\'re out on the lake and you need to cool down and you don\'t have access to indoors or AC get a t-shirt get wet wring it out a little bit put that on weight you know that\'s a good evaporative cooling can come out pretty quickly okay okay hydrate but most importantly these these type of things small things you\'re going to do out there are gonna be enough to buy you time to get in for medical treatment okay well that makes sense let\'s see what else do I have here okay so we\'ve got we let it it\'s called hyperthermia right hyperthermia heat stroke heat exhaustion what are the signs so other people can you know if someone is you know they have kids or one of their friends they\'re on a boat is it easy to spot somebody that is having problems with us are there signs to look out for so they can be like hey you need to pay attention what\'s going on you need to get in the shade you need to cool off something like that are there signs that people could easily pick out people say they\'re getting lightheaded they\'re feelingly see somebody stand up like whoa no I\'m not feeling too well if you see somebody he\'s just not that I can quite right if they\'re sweating a bunch if they\'re you know constant Fanning themselves I would say just in across the room look that\'d be the things I\'d be watching out for okay I would second Bryant\'s come in on the P if you\'re not peeing it\'s been all day long and you are peeing yeah all the weight don\'t think that\'s just a convenient all right make sure that your your your drinking your pinion taking with kiddos that\'s that\'s the number one thing to watch it you get a young kid out there make sure the therapy make sure that they\'re drinking eating their behaviour normally you know I would say with the kids they\'re sleeping a lot there are things mainly flushed you know those are all things that would be looking as a scientific maybe overexposure okay all right so get them in the shade train cool them all all right now that\'s for from an external point of view now what about okay so how can I monitor myself you know I a lot of people out there don\'t know you know if you haven\'t caught it from the website or anything this is a veteran owned and operated facility here I\'m actually a survival expert but a lot of people out there aren\'t I know what my limits are I know what to look out for but a lot of people don\'t what do you recommend okay so you said feeling light-headed and stuff if you\'re the one that\'s out there maybe you don\'t have somebody else or maybe you\'re just more aware what should you pay attention for what are the signs that you know like hey I need to really do something right now you know what should we be looking out for they go back to the P they\'re just go back to the P thing or production or thirst okay I\'m your own feeling perception now you know you feel like you\'re doing a gun if you feel hot you probably are okay alright pull yourself down get in some shape you summer backwards cool you mean to minimize exposure okay I know one of the things that we used to do when it get really really I mean you know smokin hot out there you know throwing 115 degrees one of the things that we used to do and I\'m actually curious because I know it works for me I don\'t know if there\'s a metal component to it or not but one of the things we used to do is okay so you\'ve got the shirt where you put it on when it\'s wet but one of the things that that we learned was actually to get something cold and evaporative that wraps right around here and drive some of your neck because it helps cool off the blood go into your head and there\'s actually products out there really so do I it\'s a great market line right now on the the cooling towels they sell them all across stage I have no doubt something yeah I\'m sure there\'s a lot of different products competing for that marketplace but there\'s probably something a rag or a towel or spare t-shirt or I mean virtually anything - so something like that would actually help and this is the way a swamp cooler works for LA you guys ought to have swamp coolers anytime you evaporate and you turn the liquid into a gas you\'re gonna cool it yeah if you ever pay attention to a spray King they got liquid in them they got gas in them you can warm that up in a in a sink of water shake it up and you will feel it get cool instantly okay we\'re like those cans of hairspray there when you start spraying them the whole can just artist a single and that\'s like you\'ll get from that what you\'re doing with that rag you\'re evaporating turning from a liquid to a gas you\'re evaporative cooling so yeah anywhere you can do it on your body you can do it on around your neck is there any I mean so that\'s what I was trying to bring up but is there any best way to do it or are you just trying to cool off no matter what I\'ve seen oh I said my old Scout masters would get a hat similar to yours he had a little thing that hung down on his butt he would get that wet in the river bring it out a little bit put it on his head constantly was to do that all day long that makes sense man I said cool so no I don\'t think so I don\'t think there\'s any specific algorithm you need to follow okay stay hydrated try to cool yourself off the best that you can you know if you have a fan or you have the ability to make it a little bit wet and cruising getting little wings being going against you that maybe help make sense all right we don\'t have a lot of trees here for shade that mean you might have noticed about when the Sun gets low you can find plenty of places though to in but rock is born Sun is warm to that rock so there\'s there\'s opportunities but trust yourself you\'re not feeling right start doing things they\'re doing yeah none of the people know where you\'re going to exit is that certainly helps have your cell phone with you I mean that could get pinged we you know people can be found because they have that cell phone it\'s that can be a life-saving device certainly and if you\'re on a hike and you\'re at the halfway point of your water you\'ve drank half of it your hikes it\'s time to turn around over it\'s just this yeah that makes sense well why take a chance there\'s so many things that we see are preventable I\'m just by a little bit of planning and you know thinking about interesting yourself a little bit okay that doesn\'t make sense and you were talking about the hack thing a lot of people that they\'re seen my hat I actually got this to help protect me when I was digging ditches out in the in the desert and it keeps my ears from getting burned keeps my neck from getting burned and it keeps the direct sunlight off of my head so it\'s a lot lot easier to do stuff and it doesn\'t cook your brain you\'ll be you\'ll be cooler immediately the other things use sunscreen okay there\'s aisles of that all across this communities president I\'m here absolutely it is so use sensation for you I have actually don\'t really answer this a lot of people that I\'ve talked to say that sunscreen expires and after six months or a year you should throw it away and buy new stuff do you know anything about that I would check the expiration date on the product itself okay the people who produce that okay obviously have to be able to know how long the effective ingredients are there okay and it\'ll be published on there so probably a great idea not to use expired sunscreen sorry if you put it if you talk about that much as an expired was all I have it then user yeah that\'s gonna be nothing absolutely absolutely let\'s go ahead and move on from the heat problems you know in the hydration now obviously being up here is a huge deal but we\'ve got all kinds of other problems up here it comes in let\'s let\'s start with critters you know what kind of critters do I need to worry about and if something happens with said critter what do you do what\'s your number one issue that you guys have at the hospital with critters with critters I think the things that get most people\'s attention the most people think about immediately is always gonna be around absolutely it\'s gonna be snakes I feel like me you\'re just terrified of snakes in general okay like a rattlesnake over here a rattle and I\'m double scared I guess okay but you know it\'s not the movies they don\'t jump out at you necessarily that would be a pretty doggone rare thing okay but when you get bit you know we just shared some things on our hospitals Facebook page about you know some from some of the medical directors at Banner Health mmm-hmm sharing you know there\'s there\'s a lot of things that people have done for a long don\'t capture the rattlesnake don\'t come the only one we don\'t need the rattlesnake when you come into the emergency department okay have you ever asked for a rattlesnake Jason nope not even know I think that\'s a good one don\'t uh don\'t try to suck the venom out okay what about those kids snakebite kits do you wanna speak to the snakebite kit there\'s a bunch of different kinds out there are any of them acceptable to use I\'m because officially I believe at the last guideline I heard that was that trying to suck the venom out wasn\'t really that effective but I\'m gonna defer to see I could have to look that up okay well that makes sense I mean I don\'t think it\'s gonna do a whole lot but number one thing you need to you need to focus on is getting to medical attention as quickly as possible that\'s most important thing well that was actually talking believe it or not to my dad I haven\'t seen him and I don\'t know probably eight years and we were we were having some old stories you know you\'re sitting there talking about things and when he was a kid he I think he said he was about 18 years old maybe maybe a little older than that he was living here in Arizona and he\'d go out on Jeep rows by himself he\'d go out for Weiland and he got out and he was probably 20 30 miles from the nearest highway and he decided he was gonna go exploring and climbed up this rock formation and part of the cliff and he got about halfway up to that and he threw his leg up without looking you know yeah right there and he put his leg on a rattlesnake and obviously you know if the rattlesnake bit him and he was saying you know it\'s not like the movies it\'s not like they bite and let go I had to pry that sucker off over there and then you know throw the snake away he\'s 20 miles out in the middle of nowhere he was at he was he had to use a tourniquet you know on and off trying to keep the thing but he had a CB radio in the Jeep and he was able to get ahold of someone on channel 9 and call an ambulance and they said they could meet him out on the highway and anyway he managed to be ok they got him you know they got out of the fiddle they got a mana venom and stuff but his legs swollen that was all black and it was really nasty what a snake kit maybe helping the situation like that or should they use the tourniquet method what you know I mean obviously getting medical attention is number one you know if you\'re out in the middle of nowhere what\'s the best procedure to do for a situation like that I might try to milk a little bit out there ready know right after that okay but I don\'t I guess said I\'m gonna I would have to look the answer that people do use a tourniquet well if you don\'t know how to apply those properly they can cause a lot more damage I\'d go with somebody I\'m going out by yourself yeah you know might feel very freeing and independent I mean who doesn\'t like a little a long time but you know when you\'re 20 miles away from civilization you are farther away you get when you\'re by yourself about the higher risk oh absolutely and you\'re doing it whereas if you had somebody to say hey look you drive this four-wheeler back and we\'re gonna use the CB we\'re using the cell phone we\'re gonna use whatever we can okay to contact people to have emergency personnel as close by as possible if you\'re on the National Park you utilize the National Park Service they have fantastic people yes they start rescuing we hear about that all the time we see that all the time I can imagine and in our local EMTs they\'re they\'re very well trained you know they know this piece well okay all right well that makes sense I mean you know there\'s a lot of different things I was just curious if you guys had any kind of you know even if you have the two people you could send somebody offer is there something specifically they should do I mean one of the things that mmm that we were to keep your heart rate down you know don\'t panic don\'t run don\'t walk do as little as you can so that it goes slower until you can get help does that make sense yeah I would just minimize your exertion as much as possible okay and if you have two people that way the other person goes out fighting okay and we\'ve got physicians and providers waiting to take care of you at the emergency department as well that\'s that\'s what we do all right so okay we\'ve gone through some of the critters what in this area up here other than rattlesnakes do you have to watch out for the other two venomous critters out there probably gonna be a bark scorpion or a black widow bark scorpion or a black widow okay yeah I don\'t like scorpions and I don\'t like snakes we had a freak event yeah I get into given somebody a scorpion especially you don\'t know what kind it was I would get in for evaluation the probably the same advice with the black widow or some people that don\'t have huge reactions to them but sometimes it can be really bad yeah it comes a little bit later it\'s not gonna happen right then and there at the bike typically I mean it may hurt a little bit but hours following we can get that pretty uncomfortable for some people so and black widow let\'s say that\'s a neurotoxin for black widows some reason for a scorpion oh is it okay I didn\'t know what\'s gonna just gonna ask that what kind of what kind of enema they have I know that\'s nasty but yeah they affect a pre synaptic cleft neuron and we talked about electrolytes earlier and they affect the electrolyte gated channels there okay why I didn\'t technique I learned something new today that\'s actually really interesting how about being I believe trigger multiple of the Black Widow venom sticks mostly to the calcium channels but it can cause your muscle contractions it can cause chest pain okay I\'ll have enough lactic reaction so it varies a lot depending as a person okay now I know we were talking a little bit earlier and you guys were we\'re mentioning something we\'re gonna bring it up because this is one of the big ones watching your kids oh yeah and we\'re both fathers and so all three of us are parents and you know don\'t go a full minute without knowing where your kids at and whether you\'re in the water by the water or you\'re on land maybe you\'re by your camper because all those things we\'re talking about children have a tendency to explore oh yeah quite naturally I mean that\'s that\'s a very natural instinct and so you know watching them run boats campers cars anywhere on the land you know we have we have cliffs here we know that and a lot of water that could result in bad outcomes and of course we can minimize that by keeping a close eye on our kids keep life preservers on yes they\'re out at all time always you know I\'m gonna go as far as to say if you\'re gonna have a kid out on Lake Powell probably best that they they at least are can swim and dog paddle with a life vest on my kids have these little I think they called puddle jumper it\'s like has little arm muscles and pants to a life preserver and it\'s a whatever class flotation device so have something like that there as much as Lake Powell is a totally a family friendly place and there\'s lots of great memories to be had that doesn\'t guarantee that he\'s safe it\'s actually one of the most dangerous lakes in the country statistically speaking you still have to take safety measures I mean there\'s some basic things you can do and to pray protect you and the people you care about and I think it\'s actually the law if you\'re under 16 and you\'re on the lake you need to be wearing a life jacket yes and we had unfortunately we were reported um I believe it was two weeks ago someone was out on the lake and they were in a houseboat and it was an older gentleman and he was trying to tie his boat up to his houseboat he had a bass boat he fell off and he drowned and died because he wasn\'t learning life preserver and something happened and he didn\'t make it but he could have been wearing a life jacket it\'d have been just climbing yeah so so it\'s you know that\'s tough we all want to have fun on the water of course that\'s why made they call it a recreation area yeah but you know we still have to you know to take those measures and you know I know the life vest might not be the most comfortable thing in our family the rule is or you\'re 18 great you\'re still wearing one make sense I\'m wearing one we\'re all wearing one why wouldn\'t we that\'s a really deep lake it takes an inch of water for Solana Jerome so it\'s just it\'s just not worth the risk complacency kills you might as well be safe let\'s go ready put it so anything you can do to prevent and minimize risk is worth doing that makes here\'s your safety out there is your responsibility although we have Park Service we have area ambulance we\'ve got some awesome people that that will go out there to help you that you can still be very far away and you can be in areas without cell phone reception and by the time help gets to you it may not be as fast as you as you think it might come so yeah unfortunately everybody hears about a a few bad outcomes that we have coming in off the lake or from the surrounding areas each year so be aware of your surroundings make sure that you plan and make sure you don\'t take unnecessary risks I would say one very easily modifiable risk factor one thing that makes any emergency worse is high speed okay now slow down slow down slow down that makes no need to you know to travel 50 60 70 miles an hour on the water and there\'s no need to take excessive risks you can still probably have almost as much fun as you were if you\'re not speeding all right guaranteed when an accident happened one way to make it I\'m gonna make any situation worse two ways yeah mixed in speed mixing alcohol yeah and your your situation is gonna lowers yes you can imagine so we\'ve covered some of the basics do you guys have anything specific you want to tell our audience about that good you want to just get the word out yeah I think we just hit our bullet points hydrate slow down you smart keep your eyes on your kids so those are the accidents nobody wants to happen so I think that we need to say we see 11,000 people a year in the emergency department just it a better page Hospital okay Wow as a lot of people it is a lot of people it and so as we look at that we be okay if those numbers were down a little bit because people were safer you know we\'re a community hospital that\'s why we exist we\'re here to take care of you know the people who live in our area who are visiting our area we want them to leave with photographs and memories and so if we can help them not have to visit the emergency department that\'s a great so prevent what do you know what the percentages is of preventable injuries you know like maybe it was hydration or other things of that nature I don\'t know define preventable sometimes you know it\'s so I don\'t have that broken okay well that\'s fine I just you know I mean obviously you guys have stuff that nobody can help you know you heart attack car accidents things like that I just come you know people don\'t doing maybe they were going too fast and not paying attention now we\'re live J and stuff we want to try and keep those you know if you guys are if you guys are out there pay attention to what you\'re doing you\'d be safe you want to end up in the emergency room well yeah we\'re open 24 365 and we are level four trauma center so we\'re certified with that so we have a general surgeon there 24 hours a day 365 days a year so we\'re prepared to intervene and help you but we just as soon you were just safe and didn\'t had a good time and we see everything from a flute to major major traumas that I know you\'ve reported on oh yes so we rather see the flu I don\'t blame you I don\'t blame you yeah let\'s try it let\'s try and have a safe weekend everybody is Memorial Day weekend it\'s supposed to be crazy up there they\'re gonna be people ever yeah I\'d say they\'d be hanging off the rafters but there\'s none out there so the dirty here yeah they are and there\'s more coming in I mean they\'re gonna moan all day I was your flu yeah yeah we were we were talking about that last night all of the all the national parks are just getting you know and lots of tourism so be safe out there have a great one thank you guys for joining us here with Bryan Keller and Jason Larson from banner page Hospital we appreciate you guys coming down thanks for inviting us for how to problem alright you guys have a good one and we\'ll catch you soon you', 'On The shore of Lake Powell, Lake Powell News Network LPNN Provides an in depth coverage of all the stories that matter to those right here, and in the

(58, 1, '2018-11-21 07:24:08', '2018-11-21 07:24:08', 'there is a paucity of mental health services in the community are you worried a little bit yeah there\'s really no system that\'s really looking after them we\'re just leaving them to fend for themselves I just can\'t think to myself that that functional society would agree this is how we should treat people we\'re here at Cook County Jail in Chicago which is the largest single-site jail facility in America right now it houses 9,000 inmates and it\'s estimated that 30 percent of them have mental illnesses that makes this what\'s thought to be the largest mental health care provider in America right now we go around this corner you\'re gonna go on the left-hand wall behind your back so right now we\'re headed to the morning intake area that\'s where everyone who was arrested last night is brought in and where their mental health is assessed that\'s the first point of contact in the sort of mental health treatment process that happens in Cook County Jail over a hundred arrestees were shuffling through lines getting checked for weapons and drugs and moving in and out of various ball pens and once were charged by possession yeah okay anything else Elly Montgomery is a social worker who heads up the sheriff\'s pre bond initiative my job is to help you okay before you ever started using was her depression or anxiety yeah she screams each arrestee that passes through the intake center before they see a judge a process that\'s unique to Cook County Jail never try to hurt yourself but how many times 3 3 times I think a lot about ending your life and then who helps you outside with your meds just in here see this this is a suicide hotline number you ever feel like hurting yourself you got to get off the heroin all right you\'re self-medicating all right you understand you\'re self-medicating for the depression endorses with the Harold you got violent charges what like I think nobody likes you and that\'s why sweetie the judge doesn\'t make a decision based on whether they like you they look at the charges Sarge yeah I\'m gonna have them single-celled my first suicide watch I\'ll notify books can you explain to us what just happened with that young man is actively suicide least bipolar he\'s very very worried about his case but more than anything is not oriented of time so some concerns he\'s got a plan he\'s had several since summer times before so what would have happened to that young man had he not been screened here right now he would probably have a suicide attempt because of the bipolar disorder and the illness things thought you know his thinking is a little off so he\'s kind of putting the pieces together right now and the more he puts that together and then the more anxiety and fury has the more likely he\'s gonna he\'s really gonna as morning intake came to a close we were told by Ellie and her team that 45% of the individuals they screened that day showed clear signs of mental illness Illinois was one of the top ten states that caught mental health funding between 2009 and 2012 with a 32% cut it was an attempt to help fix the state\'s fiscal crisis these budget cuts hit Illinois already beleaguered mental health system Hart the irony of this approach is that it actually cost the state more money during this time the state saw 131 million dollar increase in spending on hospitalizations and institutionalization that was the beginning of what some refer to as an all-out public health crisis amid rampant budget cuts in 2012 Rahm Emanuel closed six out of 12 public mental health care facilities in Chicago sparking outrage across communities and a flurry of media coverage have you we went to meet Cook County Sheriff Tom dart who runs the jail and has frequently spoken out for the mentally ill population he houses and treats in his facility this thing is massive it\'s a massive complex hey sheriff dart I do it very nicely we headed to Division two one of the tiers designed and operated especially for inmates who struggle with mental illness I\'ll check on your stuff today I mean I don\'t know if I can do anything before the next court date but this is complete bullshit and we all know it sheriff dart visits these facilities frequently and is familiar with the inmates in their cases you got any violence here background noise it off where have you been living before you got rank I\'m trained what and what are you accused of stealing my pair jeez okay but you were just telling the sheriff you\'ve been here for two months over one pair of stolen jeans and you were homeless before that living on the train yes sir and what are they telling you in terms of your trial of what\'s gonna happen anything of that nature you know anything at all and nothing no information visit to kind of help me with like my mental health issues mm-hmm cuz I\'m being medicated for arm bipolar depression were you receiving any treatment when you were outside of the system you know I was like use drugs oh you\'re starting taking my medic using drugs is to help medicate yourself yes 150 thousand dollar bond was set on him that\'s what he\'s got yeah so that gentleman we just bow to for stealing a pair of jeans has a hundred fifty thousand dollar bond set on that\'s why he\'s here in one of the mental health dorm units a group therapy session was taking place these are where we house our low-level mentally ill offenders these units are most always filled and it\'s one of the points of always trying to explain to people with these national crime trends all going down around the country same here we have been able to close down a couple of our divisions and the only place we\'ve ever been overcrowded in the last seven years has been our acute mentally ill floor and that\'s overcrowded almost every day and what are we watching right here right now this is a program that we contract out with a group called West care and it\'s a program is that they sit and they talk with the individual who is really trying to go through a whole litany of things here and I say okay give me the philosophy and the theory of why this person should be in here and all I keep coming cos while they committed a crime well I said well when they\'re showing up at my door within hours of having committed the offense and they\'re acutely mentally ill how can you show the attend it\'s goodbye take care take care I guess I guess through there for just however long it takes and then they\'re shot back out into the street no support and that mechanisms liver and they come right back in and all the numbers show that and so they come back in and they do it over and over and over and over again and it costs outrageous amounts of money it\'s estimated that the cost of incarcerating an individual runs around one hundred fifty dollars a day but sheriff dart told us that when you\'re dealing with somebody with serious mental illness the cost could be three times that number experts estimate that to treat the same individual outside of a correctional facility is just a fraction of this cost about ten thousand dollars annually that\'s $27 per day so how is this financially sustainable how is it financially how does it make sense it doesn\'t horrible I mean honestly god I just can\'t think to myself that a thoughtful society would agree this is how we should treat people one of the initiatives the sheriff has implemented is the mental health transition Center where inmates are offered therapeutic treatment services as they prepare to reenter their communities that\'s really messed up because something that really angers me is when when I see other people better off than I am that just like pisses me off you know like and the feelings I feel is um anger resentment sadness bitterness all mixed into one and like I don\'t have a mental illness because that\'s not like normal you know that\'s not normal a normal way to think you should be happy for your for your next man you know but with my substance abuse and my mental illness I don\'t know how to deal with this so I just resort to drinking and drugging you know I think the best thing for me would be like to be in the community you don\'t know I would like change my whole my whole future my psycho bangers like people tell me things good or bad feels what are they telling me I used to give room man right away I snap out that\'s what got me started these volcanic source lately terror it\'s just like there\'s also walking suicidal man put fuse man and destructive man you know that\'s you know that\'s bhakti pose that I can understand because we feel comfortable being uncomfortable that\'s how I would for a long time it\'s something my dad used to think I was trying to commit suicide on some weight or just on a smaller scale is just bad some narcotics it\'s it\'s a form of suicidal because I\'m not knowing what I\'m about to put in my body it doesn\'t matter to me sometimes you guys mention keep things with intimate trust issues how do we let that go how do we deal with that finally I move forward who do we say it to and what I want you guys to do with the come up and do an exercise where you come to this board here and pretend it\'s a mirror and whomever hurts you in the past whether as parents you\'ve been bullied throughout school let go of that anger let go through that resentment and tell that person what it is that you give so who would like to be the brain whiner come up and try this exercise so that this is our mirror and what I have for you is different feelings and emotions so I\'ll talk to them oh yeah I\'m very angry with you cuz I feel like you\'re abandoning me he wasn\'t there for me and I tried to see you you and see me you know and I was your only kid I didn\'t see you for seven years when I finally saw you at 13 it was like man I had so my resentment and as I got older I became just like you I abandoned everything I did everything that I loved about vanity you know so I felt so much resentment and for the next 25 30 years I just refused to even see you so when you when you found it passed away you know just seeing you in the hospital it\'s like you were trying to make a means to not be in there with me and you tried to actually get out the bed you tried you tried to embrace me but I\'m just so cold I could even embrace you because I so much going on in me and at that time man I couldn\'t even express it two months later you passed you know now I can\'t even explain these things to you man cuz you go you know and I all the hurt that I adhere to other people man I believe was a direct result man from all the stuff man that I had to get out of you and then the time all that all when they call me and they said that we had passed they told me man I had all the rights to pull the plug on you you ain\'t get that right to me how can you get that right to me and I I been no son you know these are things I wanted to tell you man and I\'m just you know I forgive you you know I know you probably was the best dad man but I forgive you man so today man I\'m a better man man I\'m getting better you realize I don\'t have no reason I love you I\'m not disappointed in you man cut you know you did what you could I love it which may be necessary to be successful without me we would no longer be blood and think about what we think about ourselves we are change why were you seeing so many mentally ill inmates coming in here you know unfortunately there is a paucity of mental health services in the community it\'s much easier for many of these individuals to see the local drug dealer on the corner waiting for them than it is to take two trains and a bus to the north side of Chicago to see a psychiatrist for five minutes what actually happened here in 2012 with the mental health care system and how was that affected this jail in 2012 the city of Chicago which had run 12 mental health clinics spread throughout the city decided to cut that in half and make it six there was no rhyme or reason there was no discussion there was no plan put together they just cut it and as a result of it we found countless detainees here waiting on their trial who would come to me and tell me over and over again you know where am I going to go what I\'m gonna do I mean that was my clinic I don\'t know what to do you know due to budget cuts and closures of mental health clinics here in the city of Chicago many of them don\'t receive psychiatric services and just being able to navigate finding them is often too difficult the state of mental health care in Chicago has become a hot button issue and was discussed during the March 26 mayoral debate a huge percentage some that some days more than half of the people arrested by the Chicago Police Department show up at the Cook County Jail and our diagnosed initial diagnosis is that they have a mental illness I became mayor our mental health entities here in the city of Chicago had lost 90 percent of the state funding because I hope badly they were managed many of the clinic\'s mayor Manuel closed were situated in vulnerable urban communities that have been generally underserved the Donna Carter is an activist who represents these communities she\'s a strong supporter of Rahm Emmanuel\'s opponent hey-zeus Chuy Garcia and a spokesperson for the mental health movement we met up with her on Chicago\'s South Side to pay a visit to some of the shot down facilities can you just tell us what are we looking at right here that is the old Woodlawn clinic where you see it says Woodlawn adult health center it was also the Woodlawn mental health clinic it was one of the oldest it was over 20 years old it had won national awards for excellent in helping stabilize families and communities so what\'s what\'s there right now right now there is one of the private providers was given that space by the city of Chicago and they are able to treat 50 people but no one knows who those 50 people are that they\'re treating the problem here is the clinic before hand had treated over 300 people Madonna took us to the site of another closed down facility on Ashland in a nearby Hispanic community there you go we\'re talking about these mental health clinics okay they never came back right where people going do you know I don\'t know you got a stand on a window I don\'t know if they it was open it we got it this was one here RINO okay you see this another window yeah no they don\'t even have psychiatrists a greater long though rated lawn has no psychiatrist at all so great at long is losing patience they have no psychiatrist at all so this was shut down April 9 2012 it was part of the six clinics absolutely I shot this place has no psychiatrist and the place that was here had psychiatrist says psychiatrists had therapists had nurse and these are all the things that you need when you\'re dealing with mental health just as with the african-american community there\'s a stigma in the Latin community the Hispanic community mental illness is not an accepted diagnosis so if you have a chance to go to a place like this that is in walking distance you go how far away is the 1600 this is 1600 West okay that is 4100 with so we\'re talking bus rides we\'re talking yes it\'s about three bus rides behind me is the Tinley Park Mental Health Center and at one point these buildings housing treated up to 2,000 mentally ill individuals right now it\'s abandoned was shut down by the governor to a huge uproar and that sort of emblematic of the problem that we\'re seeing in Chicago and actually across this country in general when these facilities are being shut down and there\'s no real safety net provided for the people that were housed and treated here psychiatric hospitals like Tinley Park made their debut in the United States in the late 18th century and were initially intended to provide therapeutic care quite the opposite of the reputation they earn for themselves by the mid 20th century lack of funding incompetent staffing and ineffective treatment led to abusive warehouse like environments by the 1950s horrific treatment of patients in these facilities became standard practice and they began the institutionalizing across the country these facilities were closed under the pretense that individuals who need care would be able to access community-based treatment and live in their homes which remains widely accepted as the most therapeutic approach in many cases the safety net was not adequately delivered a trend that persist to this day since the 1950s there has been a 95 percent decrease in psychiatric hospital bed capacity around the nation and Chicago has one of the lowest psychiatric bed capacities per capita out of any urban area in the country with mental healthcare infrastructure in Chicago hanging on by a thread and the County Jail overloaded Illinois Governor Bruce rauner is proposing another 87 million dollars and cuts the mental health spending for the 2016 budget what comes out on the other end of these policies and budget cuts is underserved urban communities where thousands of people with serious mental illnesses are out on the street untreated and unmedicated and the criminal justice system ultimately ends up having to pick up the pieces Division eight is the last year we visited during our time at the jail it\'s a huge facility designated for inmates with severe mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia the inmates are grouped into dorm like settings where they play cards and board games and sleep on small cots we spoke to two of the inmates housed here I\'m here because I\'m bipolar and antipsychotic I\'m both diagnosed with ADHD and schizoaffective and anxiety disorder were you getting a help when you were outside when you were in Chicago you know the only place I know to get my meds at Aunt Martha\'s and for me to get to Aunt Martha\'s from my town the hazel crest is it was five six bus transfers and a whole day so what\'s it like for you when you\'re not on your medication when you\'re having an episode what goes over the head I usually get real manic and real anxious like I give real fidgety and nervous and I\'m actually kind of violent usually like if I give into a altercation with somebody it\'ll usually turn out to be violent for example by my criminal damage to property residential burglary at the time I was taking schizophrenia medication bipolar anxiety and depression and what happened was me and my fiancee at the time had gotten into an altercation and she was staying with a friend of hers and due to me not having my medication and to have a sound mind I went and I busted out all the windows on his house and I ended up breaking into his house and and I blacked out and I don\'t remember what else happened but I remember I woke up and in Calumet City police station and they\'re telling me I\'m charged with burglary and criminal damage to property in the facing 4 to 15 years and what\'s it like for you when you\'re off your meds it\'s horrible but that right now my main concern my main concern is where I live what am I gonna eat but no meds or one thing no that\'s not even Brett\'s got put a roof over my head are you worried a little bit yeah cuz I know like I I\'m I have 3 felonies already and I\'ve been to prison three times and every time was because I was off my medication and it of self-medicating and once you get in the system it\'s almost impossible to get out you know you hear what these guys have to stay in it it speaks for itself you know they need treatment they need help and they\'ve sought it out and sometimes they can get in sometimes they can\'t and every time they come back in it\'s another job lost it\'s it\'s a home lost and they\'re left with nothing and there\'s really no system that\'s really looking out for them we\'re just leaving them to fend for themselves the folks here are real people their lives matter they\'re objectively mentally ill though and yet you hear these stories from them and yet we\'re supposed to treat them like a number and we\'re supposed to wait have them tell be like oh we have but 200 some people leave this jail every day and what am I supposed to do is there leave and say hey you know you wait we\'re gonna get around to study and we\'re gonna get this thing taken care of the next 20 or 30 years when you just hang in there okay', 'America’s relationship with its mentally ill population continues to suffer as

after them we\'re just leaving them to fend for themselves I just can\'t think to myself that that functional society would agree this is how we should treat people we\'re here at Cook County Jail in Chicago which is the largest single-site jail facility in America right now it houses 9,000 inmates and it\'s estimated that 30 percent of them have mental illnesses that makes this what\'s thought to be the largest mental health care provider in America right now we go around this corner you\'re gonna go on the left-hand wall behind your back so right now we\'re headed to the morning intake area that\'s where everyone who was arrested last night is brought in and where their mental health is assessed that\'s the first point of contact in the sort of mental health treatment process that happens in Cook County Jail over a hundred arrestees were shuffling through lines getting checked for weapons and drugs and moving in and out of various ball pens and once were charged by possession yeah okay anything else Elly Montgomery is a social worker who heads up the sheriff\'s pre bond initiative my job is to help you okay before you ever started using was her depression or anxiety yeah she screams each arrestee that passes through the intake center before they see a judge a process that\'s unique to Cook County Jail never try to hurt yourself but how many times 3 3 times I think a lot about ending your life and then who helps you outside with your meds just in here see this this is a suicide hotline number you ever feel like hurting yourself you got to get off the heroin all right you\'re self-medicating all right you understand you\'re self-medicating for the depression endorses with the Harold you got violent charges what like I think nobody likes you and that\'s why sweetie the judge doesn\'t make a decision based on whether they like you they look at the charges Sarge yeah I\'m gonna have them single-celled my first suicide watch I\'ll notify books can you explain to us what just happened with that young man is actively suicide least bipolar he\'s very very worried about his case but more than anything is not oriented of time so some concerns he\'s got a plan he\'s had several since summer times before so what would have happened to that young man had he not been screened here right now he would probably have a suicide attempt because of the bipolar disorder and the illness things thought you know his thinking is a little off so he\'s kind of putting the pieces together right now and the more he puts that together and then the more anxiety and fury has the more likely he\'s gonna he\'s really gonna as morning intake came to a close we were told by Ellie and her team that 45% of the individuals they screened that day showed clear signs of mental illness Illinois was one of the top ten states that caught mental health funding between 2009 and 2012 with a 32% cut it was an attempt to help fix the state\'s fiscal crisis these budget cuts hit Illinois already beleaguered mental health system Hart the irony of this approach is that it actually cost the state more money during this time the state saw 131 million dollar increase in spending on hospitalizations and institutionalization that was the beginning of what some refer to as an all-out public health crisis amid rampant budget cuts in 2012 Rahm Emanuel closed six out of 12 public mental health care facilities in Chicago sparking outrage across communities and a flurry of media coverage have you we went to meet Cook County Sheriff Tom dart who runs the jail and has frequently spoken out for the mentally ill population he houses and treats in his facility this thing is massive it\'s a massive complex hey sheriff dart I do it very nicely we headed to Division two one of the tiers designed and operated especially for inmates who struggle with mental illness I\'ll check on your stuff today I mean I don\'t know if I can do anything before the next court date but this is complete bullshit and we all know it sheriff dart visits these facilities frequently and is familiar with the inmates in their cases you got any violence here background noise it off where have you been living before you got rank I\'m trained what and what are you accused of stealing my pair jeez okay but you were just telling the sheriff you\'ve been here for two months over one pair of stolen jeans and you were homeless before that living on the train yes sir and what are they telling you in terms of your trial of what\'s gonna happen anything of that nature you know anything at all and nothing no information visit to kind of help me with like my mental health issues mm-hmm cuz I\'m being medicated for arm bipolar depression were you receiving any treatment when you were outside of the system you know I was like use drugs oh you\'re starting taking my medic using drugs is to help medicate yourself yes 150 thousand dollar bond was set on him that\'s what he\'s got yeah so that gentleman we just bow to for stealing a pair of jeans has a hundred fifty thousand dollar bond set on that\'s why he\'s here in one of the mental health dorm units a group therapy session was taking place these are where we house our low-level mentally ill offenders these units are most always filled and it\'s one of the points of always trying to explain to people with these national crime trends all going down around the country same here we have been able to close down a couple of our divisions and the only place we\'ve ever been overcrowded in the last seven years has been our acute mentally ill floor and that\'s overcrowded almost every day and what are we watching right here right now this is a program that we contract out with a group called West care and it\'s a program is that they sit and they talk with the individual who is really trying to go through a whole litany of things here and I say okay give me the philosophy and the theory of why this person should be in here and all I keep coming cos while they committed a crime well I said well when they\'re showing up at my door within hours of having committed the offense and they\'re acutely mentally ill how can you show the attend it\'s goodbye take care take care I guess I guess through there for just however long it takes and then they\'re shot back out into the street no support and that mechanisms liver and they come right back in and all the numbers show that and so they come back in and they do it over and over and over and over again and it costs outrageous amounts of money it\'s estimated that the cost of incarcerating an individual runs around one hundred fifty dollars a day but sheriff dart told us that when you\'re dealing with somebody with serious mental illness the cost could be three times that number experts estimate that to treat the same individual outside of a correctional facility is just a fraction of this cost about ten thousand dollars annually that\'s $27 per day so how is this financially sustainable how is it financially how does it make sense it doesn\'t horrible I mean honestly god I just can\'t think to myself that a thoughtful society would agree this is how we should treat people one of the initiatives the sheriff has implemented is the mental health transition Center where inmates are offered therapeutic treatment services as they prepare to reenter their communities that\'s really messed up because something that really angers me is when when I see other people better off than I am that just like pisses me off you know like and the feelings I feel is um anger resentment sadness bitterness all mixed into one and like I don\'t have a mental illness because that\'s not like normal you know that\'s not normal a normal way to think you should be happy for your for your next man you know but with my substance abuse and my mental illness I don\'t know how to deal with this so I just resort to drinking and drugging you know I think the best thing for me would be like to be in the community you don\'t know I would like change my whole my whole future my psycho bangers like people tell me things good or bad feels what are they telling me I used to give room man right away I snap out that\'s what got me started these volcanic source lately terror it\'s just like there\'s also walking suicidal man put fuse man and destructive man you know that\'s you know that\'s bhakti pose that I can understand because we feel comfortable being uncomfortable that\'s how I would for a long time it\'s something my dad used to think I was trying to commit suicide on some weight or just on a smaller scale is just bad some narcotics it\'s it\'s a form of suicidal because I\'m not knowing what I\'m about to put in my body it doesn\'t matter to me sometimes you guys mention keep things with intimate trust issues how do we let that go how do we deal with that finally I move forward who do we say it to and what I want you guys to do with the come up and do an exercise where you come to this board here and pretend it\'s a mirror and whomever hurts you in the past whether as parents you\'ve been bullied throughout school let go of that anger let go through that resentment and tell that person what it is that you give so who would like to be the brain whiner come up and try this exercise so that this is our mirror and what I have for you is different feelings and emotions so I\'ll talk to them oh yeah I\'m very angry with you cuz I feel like you\'re abandoning me he wasn\'t there for me and I tried to see you you and see me you know and I was your only kid I didn\'t see you for seven years when I finally saw you at 13 it was like man I had so my resentment and as I got older I became just like you I abandoned everything I did everything that I loved about vanity you know so I felt so much resentment and for the next 25 30 years I just refused to even see you so when you when you found it passed away you know just seeing

embrace you because I so much going on in me and at that time man I couldn\'t even express it two months later you passed you know now I can\'t even explain these things to you man cuz you go you know and I all the hurt that I adhere to other people man I believe was a direct result man from all the stuff man that I had to get out of you and then the time all that all when they call me and they said that we had passed they told me man I had all the rights to pull the plug on you you ain\'t get that right to me how can you get that right to me and I I been no son you know these are things I wanted to tell you man and I\'m just you know I forgive you you know I know you probably was the best dad man but I forgive you man so today man I\'m a better man man I\'m getting better you realize I don\'t have no reason I love you I\'m not disappointed in you man cut you know you did what you could I love it which may be necessary to be successful without me we would no longer be blood and think

classrooms working on assessments working on helping the kids grow helping the teachers grow working with parents in the community to get them involved with your school so that it becomes to be a team effort and really the the kids need to be the ones that are at the forefront and that\'s what we do there has to be in many ways I mean you can\'t do it alone can\'t just start with you when they drop off their children at school it kind of becomes a culture of excellence at home how do you get if someone said how do you engage your parents it sounds like your parents are already engaged many of them but advice you have for other schools and other principals how do you engage parents to know what they do at school continues at home well we really focus on making sure you know what your child

school I know there was the award recently you know notification but anything else or is this something that they will not necessarily recognize so much we are going to do something we have worked really hard for this all of us and so we want the students and they we want to invite the community and their parents to come and have a celebration so I\'ve already started talking to some of my parents that love to do play in things like this and we\'re gonna plan some type of celebration soon yes well it is like I said it\'s a it\'s a very big deal and we just are so congratulatory on what you\'ve achieved over there and really hope that it spreads to other schools that we have and we appreciate your time and continued success thank you that\'s outstanding thanks Kim Cunningham a collection of 25 CCSD schools have been selected by the Nevada Department of Education for their outstanding achievement helping students affected by poverty for that reason the state has named them shining star schools that means the schools are high-performing and they also serve a significant percentage of students in poverty in some elementary and middle schools as much as 75% of students qualify for free or reduced price lunch in these cases these are four or five star rated schools under the most recent Nevada school performance framework the 25 schools include 17 Elementary School\'s two middle schools and six high schools we will show you a list of all the shining star schools at the very end of this program making sure all students have access to books not just at school but at home as well that\'s what spread the word Nevada has work to do in Southern Nevada since 2001 during that time the nonprofit organization has distributed 4.7 million books to more than half a million students and those numbers are likely to get larger very soon joining us now is the co-founder of spread the word lisa hobbyhorse Lisa how are you I\'m great how are you so you\'re expanding we are tell me about that well we\'re very excited to announce that we are moving we are expanding to Washoe County so we\'re taking on schools in the Reno Sparks area we will start by our first two adoptions in November and we\'re very excited to be statewide in helping all the children in Nevada right the first thing becomes my mind is you\'re gonna need more books we are gonna need more books yes definitely so you have to get Northern Nevada kind of understanding the concept of what you do have you started them already we have we have two amazing team members up there already in an office and cleaning warehouse and all that now it\'s time to get the word out and get volunteers and get books donated and start just like we did down here 17 years ago very grassroots getting people involved and believing in what we do and helping the children up there okay well that\'s a great that\'s a great thing to do I imagine there are gonna be a couple of challenges when you kind of because although we\'re in the same state a lot of miles in between there is you know so it\'s not just easy hey run these books up to Reno yeah so there\'s some challenges a couple of those yeah for sure we\'re definitely helping to get started up there and we\'re bringing books up and so forth and get it all started but we really hope that within the next couple months rina will sustain itself all those people will start to grab on to the magic of what we\'ve done down here and it\'ll be its own self-sustaining nonprofit up there as well under our umbrella but definitely supporting itself right the importance of reading cannot be overemphasized we there are many studies that show that if a child is not proficient in reading by grade three as they get older and they need to read to be able to learn they\'ll fall behind you feel like spread the word has really added to our efforts obviously schools do a lot but do you feel like you\'re also helping me oh definitely I wouldn\'t be doing what I do if I didn\'t believe in it okay it\'s the excitement it\'s bringing the books home it\'s their ownership of books that\'s a huge part of reading when kids feel like they own their own books and they are that\'s what we do as you\'re giving them a book they don\'t have to return them exactly and then our other programs bring in the family so we\'re teaching the whole family the importance of reading together a breakfast with books or snack time with books program that\'s huge if your mom and dad think enough to come to the school to learn to read with you that means a lot to a child and shows them how important it is and then we also have our mentor centers books and buddies and that\'s taking community members and reading one-on-one with struggling readers so that excites the kids about reading that somebody cares a lot of times it\'s just checking in making sure that there and then giving them great books to read very exciting titles and you know the fun stuff dr. Seuss and all that it\'s not a textbook reading right it\'s fun reading right it\'s important that you know not all learning as we were talking on this program occurs at school it also occurs at home right most of it occurs at home right yeah okay so we talked about books you\'re gonna need books you always need books right yeah what can you tell me about if someone has books how do they get them to you they can either call the office and we\'ll schedule a pickup if we if they need to come their home or they can drop them off at our office which we\'re over by the DMV on American Pacific 1065 American Pacific out in Henderson stop by anytime we\'re open fro t every day we\'d love to have their books okay I know you also work with a lot of companies to get volunteers to come in I\'ve done this myself you have to clean the books right then I donated yeah how do you have those opportunities coming up we do we also we always do we have about five cleanings a week that are opportunities for anybody to come join they\'re on our website you can check it out the dates are listed and then you have to just register as a volunteer we\'ll get you in you you pick your spots so that we have a place for you a lot of times we haven\'t turned anybody away but sometimes we have cleaning and 70 people will show up and we\'re not prepared for that so we started doing this RSVP things so we make sure our staffing is adequate for all the people who come to help it\'s fun yeah it\'s fun and you can bring your family sure we take up to eight years old or under you know eight and older so bring your kids and let them get back to the community - we love it sounds great and we wish you success as you expand state way that\'s awesome that\'s good we\'re very excited all right Lisa thanks so much for your time you bet thank you 55 Clark County School District students have been named semi-finalists in the 2019 National Merit Scholarship Program more than 1.6 million students across the country applied to become a National Merit Scholar just last month about 16,000 students out of the 1.6 million were notified they are semi-finalists and those 55 students from CCSD are among that group each student is qualified to be a finalist based on their extensive application academic record participation in school and community activities leadership abilities employment honors and awards the toughest part of all maybe these 55 students won\'t know until February if they are a finalist well here to talk more about the National Merit Scholarship and the number of CCSD students who made the semi-finals is dr. Diane gullet she is deputy superintendent with CCSD and the semi-finalists Erin\'s son from Clark high school welcome to both of you welcome to inside education and congratulations thank you yeah so tell me about this you found out last couple of weeks tell me how that went down yeah we were in class and they called us up to the office and put us into a conference room and told us that we were all qualified as National Merit semi-finalists and everyone was really excited because it\'s an incredible honor for all of for all of us it\'s a huge huge honor so then of course you had to like tell your parents what what did you do next yeah yeah I texted my mom while I was in the room and yeah she was pretty excited too so exactly dr. gullet help us understand for those of us that are not as familiar with the National Merit Scholarship this is something that will allow many of these students to to literally choose where they want to go colleges will be after these students correct if they become a finalist absolutely and as a deputy superintendent as a parent of a National Merit Scholar I know full well that the colleges really seek these students it\'s very prestigious so there\'s opportunities through various scholarships in terms of whether they choose a college scholarship or one of the national merit scholarships so they have lots of choices in many cases we\'re talking about a full-ride scholarship correct there are colleges throughout our country who offer full rides in terms that they provide tuition and expenses so there\'s a really big array of options for them so it depends on where they want to go and then that College will often offer them some additional scholarships as well Wow so as I understand it Aaron you are now in the application phase er semifinal listen all the semi-finalists have to fill out an application includes an essay and what else there\'s also teacher Dacians obviously like personal information and also a resume with the extracurricular activities that you\'ve done throughout high school okay so you\'re the process of filling that out yeah and that will go into the running to see whether you\'re a finalist what\'s the toughest part is it the essay yeah it\'s definitely it\'s definitely the essence why is that so tough well the other parts the application are fairly straightforward like a resume and activities and stuff but the essay is where you really get to show who you are as an applicant and the application readers want to know about things like what\'s your motivation to learn or what experiences you\'ve had or really just anything that makes you unique and sitting there thinking how can I portray myself in a seven hundred word essay that\'s extremely difficult and it becomes a long process of drafting writing editing and peer review until you end up with essay that can really embody who you are and being able to read the essay and kind of see yourself in it is really satisfying but the whole process that I say writing definitely takes a while oh my gosh there\'s a lot of writing on that essay I think is what you\'re trying to say right so 19 dr. gehler 19 CCSD schools are represented with Merit Scholars five semi-finalists however one school Clark high school had I think probably I don\'t know of 75 25 or 25 students what do we say about that amazing absolutely amazing we have incredible talent and we\'re just incredibly proud of the students leadership at Clark high school I\'ve been there I\'ve walked classrooms I\'ve spent time with the leader and I could tell you takes great leadership and teachers to provide access and opportunity for these students to excel these students are very bright and very talented but providing those opportunities so they can have rigorous courses and have choices there so they can seek their path and and shine and and show the whole rest of the country what they know and what they\'re capable of what do you say about this school there\'s something going on - Clark what is it the environment yeah it\'s just like Clark is just kind of an environment that\'s really set up for academic success the students are all extremely driven to learn we have some of the most rigorous gorgeous of courses in the country and we have teachers who are really passionate about what they teach and always willing to help out the students and we also have a staff and administration that\'s always setting up setting us up for success they\'re always willing to help and they\'re always providing us with opportunities to pursue what everybody want to go into after high school that\'s great before we go I want to find out what what are your plans obviously to go to college but you have a field of study and you have a dream job well right now I really like entrepreneurship and I also really like studying math and science so ideally I would like to become an entrepreneur who uses math and science to create disruptive technologies I\'ve done a little bit of both I\'ve done some entrepreneurship with patenting and development and I\'ve also done some research at places like Stony Brook University and the National Institutes of Health and I really really love doing both so I like to mix the two together as for college I don\'t really have a specific place right now I\'m in the middle of the process you have some time you have some time but I just want to go to a good school that will allow me to pursue an education in mathematics and computer science I think you\'re gonna find it Aaron we wish you the absolute most success we can congratulations again dr. gullet thanks for joining us today my pleasure well finally we want to pass along a well-earned congratulations Clark high school Zeeshan Vakeel did very well during the 3rd international history Olympiad held in Berlin Germany recently the kil competed against 224 students representing 20 different countries including 20 different US states and came away with 3 gold to silver and 5 bronze medals the collection of medals helped Deshawn compile one of the most outstanding performances of any student at the competition he earned gold medals in the art history be a quiz tournament on the period of colonization in Africa as well as the history of the Berlin exam big congratulations to Ishaan the kill and we want to thank you for tuning in to insideeducation whether you\'re a student parent staff member or tax payer we all have a stake in the public education system a quick reminder that you can find this episode and past episodes of inside education on the Vegas PBS website that\'s Vegas PBS Oh RG or the Vegas PBS YouTube page as promised we\'ll be back in two weeks with more stories and interviews that take you inside the Clark County School District and we leave you now with the names of all those shining star schools congratulations to them we\'ll see you soon you', 'CCSD and other celebrate Week of Respect, and we look at school and student achievement.', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'ccsd-and-other-celebrate-week-of-respect-and-we-look-at-school-and-student-achievement', '', '', '2018-11-21 07:26:04', '2018-11-21 07:26:04', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=61', 0, 'post', '', 0),

because although we\'re in the same state a lot of miles in between there is you know so it\'s not just easy hey run these books up to Reno yeah so there\'s some challenges a couple of those yeah for sure we\'re definitely helping to get started up there and we\'re bringing books up and so forth and get it all started but we really hope that within the next couple months rina will sustain itself all those people will start to grab on to the magic of what we\'ve done down here and it\'ll be its own self-sustaining nonprofit up there as well under our umbrella but definitely supporting itself right the importance of reading cannot be overemphasized we there are many studies that show that if a child is not proficient in reading by grade three as they get older and they need to read to be able to learn they\'ll fall behind you feel like spread the word has really added to our efforts obviously schools do a lot but do you feel like you\'re also helping me oh definitely I wouldn\'t be doing what I do if I didn\'t believe in it okay it\'s the excitement it\'s bringing the books home it\'s their ownership of books that\'s a huge part of reading when kids feel like they own their own books and they are that\'s what we do as you\'re giving them a book they don\'t have to return them exactly and then our other programs bring in the family so we\'re teaching the whole family the importance of reading together a breakfast with books or snack time with books program that\'s huge if your mom and dad think enough to come to the school to learn to read with you that means a lot to a child and shows them how important it is and then we also have our mentor centers books and buddies and that\'s taking community members and reading one-on-one with struggling readers so that excites the kids about reading that somebody cares a lot of times it\'s just checking in making sure that there and then giving them great books to read very exciting titles and you know the fun stuff dr. Seuss and all that it\'s not a textbook reading right it\'s fun reading right it\'s important that you know not all learning as we were talking on this program occurs at school it also occurs at home right most of it occurs at home right yeah okay so we talked about books you\'re gonna need books you always need books right yeah what can you tell me about if someone has books how do they get them to you they can either call the office and we\'ll schedule a pickup if we if they need to come their home or they can drop them off at our office which we\'re over by the DMV on American Pacific 1065 American Pacific out in Henderson stop by anytime we\'re open fro t every day we\'d love to have their books okay I know you also work with a lot of companies to get volunteers to come in I\'ve done this myself you have to clean the books right then I donated yeah how do you have those opportunities coming up we do we also we always do we have about five cleanings a week that are opportunities for anybody to come join they\'re on our website you can check it out the dates are listed and then you have to just register as a volunteer we\'ll get you in you you pick your spots so that we have a place for you a lot of times we haven\'t turned anybody away but sometimes we have cleaning and 70 people will show up and we\'re not prepared for that so we started doing this RSVP things so we make sure our staffing is adequate for all the people who come to help it\'s fun yeah it\'s fun and you can bring your family sure we take up to eight years old or under you know eight and older so bring your kids and let them get back to the community - we love it sounds great and we wish you success as you expand state way that\'s awesome that\'s good we\'re very excited all right Lisa thanks so much for your time you bet thank you 55 Clark County School District students have been named semi-finalists in the 2019 National Merit Scholarship Program more than 1.6 million students across the country applied to become a National Merit Scholar just last month about 16,000 students out of the 1.6 million were notified they are semi-finalists and those 55 students from CCSD are among that group each student is qualified to be a finalist based on their extensive application academic record participation in school and community activities leadership abilities employment honors and awards the toughest part of all maybe these 55 students won\'t know until February if they are a finalist well here to talk more about the National Merit Scholarship and the number of CCSD students who made the semi-finals is dr. Diane gullet she is deputy superintendent with CCSD and the semi-finalists Erin\'s son from Clark high school welcome to both of you welcome to inside education and congratulations thank you yeah so tell me about this you found out last couple of weeks tell me how that went down yeah we were in class and they called us up to the office and put us into a conference room and told us that we were all qualified as National Merit semi-finalists and everyone was really excited because it\'s an incredible honor for all of for all of us it\'s a huge huge honor so then of course you had to like tell your parents what what did you do next yeah yeah I texted my mom while I was in the room and yeah she was pretty excited too so exactly dr. gullet help us understand for those of us that are not as familiar with the National Merit Scholarship this is something that will allow many of these students to to literally choose where they want to go colleges will be after these students correct if they become a finalist absolutely and as a deputy superintendent as a parent of a National Merit Scholar I know full well that the colleges really seek these students it\'s very prestigious so there\'s opportunities through various scholarships in terms of whether they choose a college scholarship or one of the national merit scholarships so they have lots of choices in many cases we\'re talking about a full-ride scholarship correct there are colleges throughout our country who offer full rides in terms that they provide tuition and expenses so there\'s a really big array of options for them so it depends on where they want to go and then that College will often offer them some additional scholarships as well Wow so as I understand it Aaron you are now in the application phase er semifinal listen all the semi-finalists have to fill out an application includes an essay and what else there\'s also teacher Dacians obviously like personal information and also a resume with the extracurricular activities that you\'ve done throughout high school okay so you\'re the process of filling that out yeah and that will go into the running to see whether you\'re a finalist what\'s the toughest part is it the essay yeah it\'s definitely it\'s definitely the essence why is that so tough well the other parts the application are fairly straightforward like a resume and activities and stuff but the essay is where you really get to show who you are as an applicant and the application readers want to know about things like what\'s your motivation to learn or what experiences you\'ve had or really just anything that makes you unique and sitting there thinking how can I portray myself in a seven hundred word essay that\'s extremely difficult and it becomes a long process of drafting writing editing and peer review until you end up with essay that can really embody who you are and being able to read the essay and kind of see yourself in it is really satisfying but the whole process that I say writing definitely takes a while oh my gosh there\'s a lot of writing on that essay I think is what you\'re trying to say right so 19 dr. gehler 19 CCSD schools are represented with Merit Scholars five semi-finalists however one school Clark high school had I think probably I don\'t know of 75 25 or 25 students what do we say about that amazing absolutely amazing we have incredible talent and we\'re just incredibly proud of the students leadership at Clark high school I\'ve been there I\'ve walked classrooms I\'ve spent time with the leader and I could tell you takes great leadership and teachers to provide access and opportunity for these students to excel these students are very bright and very talented but providing those opportunities so they can have rigorous courses and have choices there so they can seek their path and and shine and and show the whole rest of the country what they know and what they\'re capable of what do you say about this school there\'s something going on - Clark what is it the environment yeah it\'s just like Clark is just kind of an environment that\'s really set up for academic success the students are all extremely driven to learn we have some of the most rigorous gorgeous of courses in the country and we have teachers who are really passionate about what they teach and always willing to help out the students and we also have a staff and administration that\'s always setting up setting us up for success they\'re always willing to help and they\'re always providing us with opportunities to pursue what everybody want to go into after high school that\'s great before we go I want to find out what what are your plans obviously to go to college but you have a field of study and you have a dream job well right now I really like entrepreneurship and I also really like studying math and science so ideally I would like to become an entrepreneur who uses math and science to create disruptive technologies I\'ve done a little bit of both I\'ve done some entrepreneurship with patenting and development and I\'ve also done some research at places like Stony Brook University and the National Institutes of Health and I really really love doing both so I like to mix the two together as for college I don\'t really have a specific place right now I\'m in the middle of the process you have some time you have some time but I just want to go to a good school that will allow me to pursue an education in mathematics and computer science I think you\'re gonna find it Aaron we wish you the absolute most success we can congratulations again dr. gullet thanks for joining us today my pleasure well finally we want to pass along a well-earned congratulations Clark high school Zeeshan Vakeel did very well during the 3rd international history Olympiad held in Berlin Germany recently the kil competed against 224 students representing 20 different countries including 20 different US states and came away with 3 gold to silver and 5 bronze medals the collection of medals helped Deshawn compile one of the most outstanding performances of any student at the competition he earned gold medals in the art history be a quiz tournament on the period of colonization in Africa as well as the history of the Berlin exam big congratulations to Ishaan the kill and we want to thank you for tuning in to insideeducation whether you\'re a student parent staff member or tax payer we all have a stake in the public education system a quick reminder that you can find this episode and past episodes of inside education on the Vegas PBS website that\'s Vegas PBS Oh RG or the Vegas PBS YouTube page as promised we\'ll be back in two weeks with more stories and interviews that take you inside the Clark County School District and we leave you now with the names of all those shining star schools congratulations to them we\'ll see you soon you', 'CCSD and other celebrate Week of Respect, and we look at school and student achievement.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '61-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-11-21 07:26:04', '2018-11-21 07:26:04', '', 61, 'http://localhost/wordpress/63/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

willingness to serve in these roles finally I want to thank my friend Jonathan over B who is here absolutely because of his talent but also in large part due to the personal request of my wife Cathy da doctor over B thanks today I\'d like to start out by talking about some of the exciting things that are happening in our schools and difficult challenges that we face lately I\'ve been thinking about this year\'s kindergarten class um because my granddaughter Kendall here today kindergartner and lapham school here in Madison I spend a lot of time thinking about what kindergarteners across the state will need to succeed the challenges their teachers will face and of course who\'s going to pay for it and how much some of you may know this but Kathy and I first met in kindergarten Plymouth Wisconsin we were in miss Potter\'s class while Cathy remains a constant in my life I will tell you that things and education ovulates obviously has changed the layout of our classrooms how we approach teaching our schools and public libraries even our class our playgrounds look different in the midst of all this change our state has obviously become more diverse growing up as a small town kid the first time I met someone who wasn\'t white was when I was working on a summer job and a canning factory just down the road from my home I think that my story may be similar to many Wisconsin nights my age and while this may seem like a recollection from a bygone era there are still places where this story could be pulled true today so what\'s changed and what\'s remain the same in most cat classrooms across the state the kindergarteners who showed up and Kendall\'s classroom as well as others showed up and our learning great things already but they\'re more diverse in all kinds of ways they come to schools with different life experiences and different needs I believe the opportunity for each and every child to excel especially our kids of color is one of the great moral issues of our day to succeed we need honest talk about the shared benefit of a system that promotes excellence for all I spread some I spent some time this summer with educational leaders who are around the country talking about equity and one of the things I took from this work is that while Wisconsin\'s achievement gaps are large we\'re not unique what did inspire me though was the honesty of my peers and the urgency that they have to address the root causes of inequity they did not shy away from courageous conversations and and yet they were also incredibly hopeful that this will be an era that improves the lives of color all across the united states and frankly you can\'t afford to lose that momentum our state and our nation does not leave this walls kindergarteners a problem that our today\'s leaders and all of us fail to recognize equity cannot be a discussion about improving the lives of some other kids some other kids from other parents if we see this as an issue of one school district or one school building we all fail this is about ensuring the prosperity of the next generation the students no matter their race no matter whether they have a disability and no matter who they love each and every one of them deserves our as a white guy from Plymouth I know this can be uncomfortable at times believe me there are growing pains but much like building relationships is absolutely crucial to helping kindergartner succeed the same holds true for solving adult issues it\'s hard to have honest conversations without getting defensive but i\'m pretty sure folks of color denton based din\'t invent racism women didn\'t ask for sexism gay kids did not create homophobia and babies are not born bigots those powerful and insistent carriers won\'t go away unless we take tackle them together you\'ve been in a school recently you saw that our educators are working to make sure each student meets his or her full potential and they recognize that each kid may need the extra lift to get there while I always say that every day that I visit a classroom is my favorite day one visit this last year really stuck out stuck to me i was on a high school fine arts visit in milwaukee talking with students about their work now you have to know and i know my wife Cathy noses I\'m not particularly artsy so I was absolutely out of my element in woodworking pottery graphics and design I saw a student with red hair and when I say red I mean it was red enough for me to walk walk up to her and ask her about her work her name was leslie and she came to the u.s. at the age of five and started school as an English Learner she\'s one of our immigrant students she navigated me through her portfolio explain how her art followed her through her life church journey both the good times and the bad times she talked about her the role her teachers played in her life she explained our art grew with her needless to say I was really impressed she then told me that she has she secured over ninety thousand dollars in scholarships to go to a university here in Wisconsin how about that she was so confident in describing her next steps that I knew I could push her a little bit I hope I found a nice way to say this to her but what I was thinking was what on earth are you gonna do with an arts degree she smiled and told me she was planning not to become an artist she is going to school for biology she told me the skills she learned as an artist perseverance rescission determination translate perfectly for the study of biology her school experience instilled in her the ability to persevere in any field so that while we talk about change in education one of a constant is a determination of our educators to serve kids like Leslie and kindergarteners across the state you\'ll find classroom led by people that give their hearts and souls to these kids day in and day out and you know what kindergarten teachers are like and thank goodness they do because when our students need that extra lift we need great educators more today than ever before but here\'s the question how long can we lean on educators to manage the change alone our state must take action to support our educators so that they can focus on helping every kid there are issues that we can no longer afford to ignore issues that are should not be left alone tackled by our educators alone to wit mental health supports for families and kids are stretched thin and frankly in many parts of the state are non-existent according to a recent center for disease control and prevention study up to one in five of Wisconsin kids as a mental health challenge one in five get this over half of our school-aged children face at least one identified form of adversity and these numbers cut across all demographics groups whether it\'s because mom lost her job or Paris the wars or any number of other traumas it means that half of Wisconsin 60,000 kindergarteners will need an extra lift to help them achieve their potential and educators will need help with that extra lift throughout our state I see schools working across sectors public and private to provide mental health services for our kids the state let\'s ratchet up its Flajnik financial commitments in this arena the community school model is another example of providing providing that extra lift these schools drive a child\'s success by removing barriers to learning by providing services like health care or extending building hours and facility use for families or coordinating job training and counseling skills students and their families together can reach full potential school as community community as school school nutrition programs can also provide that extra lift this year in superior I learned how critical a nutrition program is to helping kids achieve their one of the growing number of school districts that offer breakfast lunch and dinner to students and families the director of the program trains the staff to watch kid for kids faltering in the line on Monday morning because that may mean that kid did not eat that previous weekend and we cannot forget about the valuable role our libraries play all across the state school and public libraries are responding to the needs of children and families who need that extra lift not to be clear community schools libraries top-notch nutrition programs are not silver bolus in fact one of the things that keeps me up keeps me awake at night is wondering how far a system is stretched by changes without the proper support to remote excellence for every kid we cannot ignore the critical staffing shortages many of our districts face the most important factor to student success is access to a high quality teacher that was true 60 years ago when I was in kindergarten a long time ago but that also holds true today to put it simply not enough of our young people are considering careers in education as a member of the board of reasons I\'ve eaten lunch in my fair share of college cafeterias and if you want to talk change holy mackerel those places have changed as have the food has gotten a lot better but in my eight years of sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with college kids I\'ve never sat down to someone who has told me that they are pursuing a career in education not once now that\'s anecdotal bit of evidence here are some hard data graduation in enrollment in Wisconsin education programs is way down when compared to 2009 a cts surveys of test test takers indicates that fewer and fewer students are preferring education as a career and according to data collected from our district staffing survey districts are having a harder and harder time filling those high demand positions a special education bilingual education and career and technical education last month I begin begin efforts to help address those shortages through emergency rules designed to reduce hurdles for districts facing staffing issues these changes were identified by a group of administrators and teachers intent on making an impact without dumbing down the quality of the profession no matter what we do to remove barriers we still need the best and brightest and we cannot compromise on quality and that will not change either some of those changes may require us to engage policymakers to build long-term solutions but one strategy to send a positive message to our young people is absolutely free and we can do it today we need to end the negative rhetoric surrounding the teaching profession this is obvious no one becomes a teacher thinking they\'re going to become a millionaire that\'s that I firmly believe that educators across Wisconsin are under under compensated for the complexity and sheer weight of the work they do if you needed an example look no further than last year\'s national teacher the Wisconsin Teacher of the Year representative Roger King from home in high school let me tell you how Roger defines teacher Roger believes in parental and family involvement and he practices what he preaches he was his advisory committees made up of parents business folks and families to inform his teaching he pushes his students to investigate real-world problems his classes retooled or school green greenhouse to leverage a year-round growing cycle Roger is an FFA advisor a 4-h leader he coaches football and he serves as a co-chair for the La Crosse County interstate fair small animal barn committee I\'m not sure when Roger sleeps I\'m also convinced that Roger is not alone in his dedication to the job he\'s part and parcel of what we what we look at when we define teacher in Wisconsin he and our other Wisconsin educators deserve our thanks a round of applause teachers teach because they care about kids it\'s true back in my kindergarten classroom still true today and that however does not mean you should ignore the facts a recent study published by the economic policy institute show that us teachers had weekly wages so it\'s a direct comparison weekly wages that was seventeen percent lower than their college-educated peers well that statistic absolutely contributes to our staffing shortages it\'s a problem that\'s inherently tied to how we fund our schools from 2009 to 2014 Wisconsin ranked at the bottom for change and teacher paid according to the US census bureau a two point four percent decrease in take-home pay over six years the same stats show us among the lowest states for change and spending per student at just one percent change across those last five years we cannot afford to let that these trends continue the founders of our state crafted a system of public education and while they may not have ever pictured the candles classrooms of today they put great value on the idea of equitable of an equitable system last time our state\'s funding system was reviewed by Wisconsin Supreme Court the Court outlined three groups as key indicators of distress English language learners students with disabilities and students in poverty I worry that each year that we kicked the can down the road instead of addressing our funding problems we risk failing our obligation to all our kids and I know the public is with us as we around a need to address funding reform over the past five years passages of referenda have dramatically increased today almost eighty percent of school districts approve referendum citizens are voting to tax themselves because the state ain\'t pulling its weight no district should have to go to a referendum every 33 years to keep the doors open polling also confuses show that public the public favors more state funding for our schools but for every eight districts that can pass a referendum in today\'s environment there are two that can\'t this is already creating a system of haves and have-nots it\'s not acceptable it\'s not acceptable to my grandchildren sitting over there people around the state are taking notice it was two years ago and lead up to the budget cycle that I first began to notice grassroots Paris groups popping up all across Wisconsin a few weeks ago I gave some remarks at their second annual summit was floored by the number of additional groups that have organically formed around their communities and their owner kids I see some of them are in the audience today and I want to thank them for what they\'re doing to advance a bipartisan conversation around school funding thank you so much when i visit districts largest wall I see some really exciting things despite our challenges there is constant innovation and drive for excellence for all our kids from Fort Atkinson where a pond becomes a classroom to three lakes where the community works alongside their young people in a state-of-the-art Fab Lab from the student portfolios in West Salem and cutting and to the tots top-notch CTE programs in menomonie and nekoosa I could not be more prouder of the learning and innovation I see it\'s in large part because when I visit schools I meet people like Leslie the artists and future biologists since stories like Leslie\'s stories of kids growing and receiving the extra lift they need that illustrate the value our schools provide to the state if you dig deeper you\'ll find that her success was tied to a team of educators who helped her reach explore and grow without high-quality educators and staff those school buildings would be nothing but bricks so I want to close by asking something of each and every one of you and it\'s not small and it will not be easy but you\'re here because you care so you\'re clearly the right person to people to ask to help shoulder this burden we desperately need broad support to achieve excellence for each and every child we also need people who are willing to be honest people willing to talk to each other about inequities people willing to find strength and diversity that makes Wisconsin and America great you can do it and we can do this together I am convinced that if we speak up together with candor without fear solving our equity problems around school funding and school staffing will come it will come for every kid in Wisconsin we all at the kendall and a fellow kindergarteners across the state of Wisconsin to receive that extra lift to succeed I hope you\'ll join us and thank you so much for being

instilled in her the ability to persevere in any field so that while we talk about change in education one of a constant is a determination of our educators to serve kids like Leslie and kindergarteners across the state you\'ll find classroom led by people that give their hearts and souls to these kids day in and day out and you know what kindergarten teachers are like and thank goodness they do because when our students need that extra lift we need great educators more today than ever before but here\'s the question how long can we lean on educators to manage the change alone our state must take action to support our educators so that they can focus on helping every kid there are issues that we can no longer afford to ignore issues that are should not be left alone tackled by our educators alone to wit mental health supports for families and kids are stretched thin and frankly in many parts of the state are non-existent according to a recent center for disease control and prevention study up to one in five of Wisconsin kids as a mental health challenge one in five get this over half of our school-aged children face at least one identified form of adversity and these numbers cut across all demographics groups whether it\'s because mom lost her job or Paris the wars or any number of other traumas it means that half of Wisconsin 60,000 kindergarteners will need an extra lift to help them achieve their potential and educators will need help with that extra lift throughout our state I see schools working across sectors public and private to provide mental health services for our kids the state let\'s ratchet up its Flajnik financial commitments in this arena the community school model is another example of providing providing that extra lift these schools drive a child\'s success by removing barriers to learning by providing services like health care or extending building hours and facility use for families or coordinating job training and counseling skills students and their families together can reach full potential school as community community as school school nutrition programs can also provide that extra lift this year in superior I learned how critical a nutrition program is to helping kids achieve their one of the growing number of school districts that offer breakfast lunch and dinner to students and families the director of the program trains the staff to watch kid for kids faltering in the line on Monday morning because that may mean that kid did not eat that previous weekend and we cannot forget about the valuable role our libraries play all across the state school and public libraries are responding to the needs of children and families who need that extra lift not to be clear community schools libraries top-notch nutrition programs are not silver bolus in fact one of the things that keeps me up keeps me awake at night is wondering how far a system is stretched by changes without the proper support to remote excellence for every kid we cannot ignore the critical staffing shortages many of our districts face the most important factor to student success is access to a high quality teacher that was true 60 years ago when I was in kindergarten a long time ago but that also holds true today to put it simply not enough of our young people are considering careers in education as a member of the board of reasons I\'ve eaten lunch in my fair share of college cafeterias and if you want to talk change holy mackerel those places have changed as have the food has gotten a lot better but in my eight years of sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with college kids I\'ve never sat down to someone who has told me that they are pursuing a career in education not once now that\'s anecdotal bit of evidence here are some hard data graduation in enrollment in Wisconsin education programs is way down when compared to 2009 a cts surveys of test test takers indicates that fewer and fewer students are preferring education as a career and according to data collected from our district staffing survey districts are having a harder and harder time filling those high demand positions a special education bilingual education and career and technical education last month I begin begin efforts to help address those shortages through emergency rules designed to reduce hurdles for districts facing staffing issues these changes were identified by a group of administrators and teachers intent on making an impact without dumbing down the quality of the profession no matter what we do to remove barriers we still need the best and brightest and we cannot compromise on quality and that will not change either some of those changes may require us to engage policymakers to build long-term solutions but one strategy to send a positive message to our young people is absolutely free and we can do it today we need to end the negative rhetoric surrounding the teaching profession this is obvious no one becomes a teacher thinking they\'re going to become a millionaire that\'s that I firmly believe that educators across Wisconsin are under under compensated for the complexity and sheer weight of the work they do if you needed an example look no further than last year\'s national teacher the Wisconsin Teacher of the Year representative Roger King from home in high school let me tell you how Roger defines teacher Roger believes in parental and family involvement and he practices what he preaches he was his advisory committees made up of parents business folks and families to inform his teaching he pushes his students to investigate real-world problems his classes retooled or school green greenhouse to leverage a year-round growing cycle Roger is an FFA advisor a 4-h leader he coaches football and he serves as a co-chair for the La Crosse County interstate fair small animal barn committee I\'m not sure when Roger sleeps I\'m also convinced that Roger is not alone in his dedication to the job he\'s part and parcel of what we what we look at when we define teacher in Wisconsin he and our other Wisconsin educators deserve our thanks a round of applause teachers teach because they care about kids it\'s true back in my kindergarten classroom still true today and that however does not mean you should ignore the facts a recent study published by the economic policy institute show that us teachers had weekly wages so it\'s a direct comparison weekly wages that was seventeen percent lower than their college-educated peers well that statistic absolutely contributes to our staffing shortages it\'s a problem that\'s inherently tied to how we fund our schools from 2009 to 2014 Wisconsin ranked at the bottom for change and teacher paid according to the US census bureau a two point four percent decrease in take-home pay over six years the same stats show us among the lowest states for change and spending per student at just one percent change across those last five years we cannot afford to let that these trends continue the founders of our state crafted a system of public education and while they may not have ever pictured the candles classrooms of today they put great value on the idea of equitable of an equitable system last time our state\'s funding system was reviewed by Wisconsin Supreme Court the Court outlined three groups as key indicators of distress English language learners students with disabilities and students in poverty I worry that each year that we kicked the can down the road instead of addressing our funding problems we risk failing our obligation to all our kids and I know the public is with us as we around a need to address funding reform over the past five years passages of referenda have dramatically increased today almost eighty percent of school districts approve referendum citizens are voting to tax themselves because the state ain\'t pulling its weight no district should have to go to a referendum every 33 years to keep the doors open polling also confuses show that public the public favors more state funding for our schools but for every eight districts that can pass a referendum in today\'s environment there are two that can\'t this is already creating a system of haves and have-nots it\'s not acceptable it\'s not acceptable to my grandchildren sitting over there people around the state are taking notice it was two years ago and lead up to the budget cycle that I first began to notice grassroots Paris groups popping up all across Wisconsin a few weeks ago I gave some remarks at their second annual summit was floored by the number of additional groups that have organically formed around their communities and their owner kids I see some of them are in the audience today and I want to thank them for what they\'re doing to advance a bipartisan conversation around school funding thank you so much when i visit districts largest wall I see some really exciting things despite our challenges there is constant innovation and drive for excellence for all our kids from Fort Atkinson where a pond becomes a classroom to three lakes where the community works alongside their young people in a state-of-the-art Fab Lab from the student portfolios in West Salem and cutting and to the tots top-notch CTE programs in menomonie and nekoosa I could not be more prouder of the learning and innovation I see it\'s in large part because when I visit schools I meet people like Leslie the artists and future biologists since stories like Leslie\'s stories of kids growing and receiving the extra lift they need that illustrate the value our schools provide to the state if you dig deeper you\'ll find that her success was tied to a team of educators who helped her reach explore and grow without high-quality educators and staff those school buildings would be nothing but bricks so I want to close by asking something of each and every one of you and it\'s not small and it will not be easy but you\'re here because you care so you\'re clearly the right person to people to ask to help shoulder this burden we desperately need broad support to achieve excellence for each and every child we also need people who are willing to be honest people willing to talk to each other about inequities people willing to find strength and diversity that makes Wisconsin and America great you can do it and we can do this together I am convinced that if we speak up together with candor without fear solving our equity problems around school funding and school staffing will come it will come for every kid in Wisconsin we all at the kendall and a fellow kindergarteners across the state of Wisconsin to receive that extra lift to succeed I hope you\'ll join us and thank you so much for being

much for taking the time to tune in and join us today my name is Sarah caz Merrick I\'m in our office of public affairs i\'m joined today by a new guest Melissa Emory eres a director in Gio\'s education workforce an income security team Melissa thanks so much for joining us today thanks so much for having me here and today we\'re going to be talking about veterans and higher education Melissa\'s team recently released a report on this topic looking in part at schools recruitment of student veterans for a little more context or information about the report you can find online in our website that\'s Gao gov and the report number to look for is Gao 14 324 and you can find it right there on our homepage again it\'s geo dish 14 dash 324 so before we get started I want to talk about how you can send in your questions for the chat today we\'ve already gotten a few questions in over email and thanks for those of you who have set in your questions already you can send them in over email to ask GL live at Gao gov if you\'re on social media you can also send them in over Twitter just use the hashtag ask gio live so we\'ll be keeping an eye out for your emails and tweets and we\'ll do our best to get you a response so Melissa could you start us off with an introduction to yourself and your work at Gao sure I work on education issues and we do national studies on everything from elementary school in high school to college issues and I focus a lot on higher education so this is college trade school for older students and we\'ve done work ranging from covering the cost of student loans to the cost of textbooks to what it\'s like for veterans returning as students with their GI Bill benefits and we\'ve done several reports on this topic including the one that was released yesterday and could you tell us a little bit more about the report that came out yesterday look schools recruitment of student veterans happy to do so this is a very exciting report prior to this report there had only been anecdotal information on the experience of student veterans during that school search in a recruitment process and we actually obtained nationally generalizable data about this population so we have real numbers to talk about the experience of students using their GI Bill benefits to go to school well let me jump right in and ask you then what did veterans tell you about their experience being recruited by schools we found that thousands of veterans were experiencing negative recruitment processes when being recruited by schools and what that comes down to is veterans told us that they were being contacted excessively by schools in terms of the number of emails and phone calls that they were receiving and the numbers of veterans affected by this is significant our survey shows that about fifteen thousand veterans reported having negative experiences with schools in terms of excessive contact beyond that closer to seven thousand veterans indicated that they had experiences feeling coerced into attending a school so this is a significant concern given that these veterans have served our country and we want them to have a good transition to college life and yet they\'re feeling harassed and coerced when they\'re in this process of selecting a school well let me turn to the first question that we\'ve gotten from our audience here a question comes from dan over email and dan would like to know how many veterans did we survey in this report sure so our survey results are generalizable to the whole population of veterans that first started receiving benefits in 2012 and that was seventy three thousand veterans so we did a statistical sample of surveying 900 of them but it actually is generalized to that whole population of 73 thousand people receiving GI Bill benefits for the first time in 2012 and Dan had a second question for us and his question is did you report all look at graduation rates for these student veterans our report asked veterans what information they wanted and they wanted information on graduate graduation rates and actually we have a figure on that it\'s figure 1 if you look at that this is not the actual graduation rate of student veterans but it\'s the percentage of students we surveyed who said that they wanted more information on graduation rates and you can see here in this graphic that they also wanted more information on support services for veterans on campus as well as information on transferring credits and also how much they were going to be on the hook for in terms of student loan debt when they graduated well turning back to what veterans said to it said in the survey I have a question here from Sam over email and Sam would like to know if that\'s felt like they were being lied to or misled by the schools we we did hear that we had a significant number of veterans tell us that they were receiving inaccurate information and when you look at the actual numbers of people affected it\'s about 16,000 veterans reported receiving what they thought of as inaccurate information and this could be on graduation rates that they were being told by the school or it could be about financial aid or job placement rates so this is really key information and they felt like they were not receiving the truth from schools let me ask you to follow our very related question that came in from Randy over email and Randy would like to know is it harder for veterans to get it good information about schools and if so why would that be that\'s a good question i think veterans are coming from the military so they\'re not coming from a high school with maybe a guidance counselor to sit with them and kind of guide them through the process and many of the veterans coming back maybe first-generation college students so they may be coming from families without those supports in place and it\'s not always easy to find the information that you need we actually looked at a lot of these websites and had trouble ourselves finding information so we were looking for information on the graduation rates or the job placement rates and sometimes you would find it in these obscure corners of the website like consumer disclosures places that no one in their right mind would ever visit and that\'s where they put this information and people couldn\'t find it and I think that\'s what you\'re seeing there in that graphic is that people wanted information it felt like they couldn\'t find it that\'s got to make it really challenging for vets as they try to make informed choices about what schools they might want to attend yes very much so and one of our recommendations in this report is to make sure that they have more assistance in making those choices and it\'s interesting the Department of Veterans Affairs actually has something like a guidance counselor they have counselors who are available to provide assistance regarding educational counseling and it\'s free for folks who have these GI Bill benefits and it\'s one-on-one yet about half of the people that we surveyed had no knowledge that this existed that\'s got to be a big challenge it is i\'m going to turn to our next question from erica over an email and Erica would like to know how is veteran recruitment different from regular student recruitment or recruitment of other kinds of students that\'s a great question Thank You Erica for posing it I think it\'s different for veterans because they have specific offices at schools that are focused on veteran recruitment so they may have particular officials whose sole job it is to look for student veterans to encourage them to apply for their schools so they tailor email and phone communications to the veteran population they advertise in print and online media for veterans and if you go on a lot of schools websites you\'ll see a lot of images about people wearing military clothing the websites will cite that their military friendly and the like so I think there\'s a big push to enroll students who are veterans and who have GI Bill benefits we have a really good question from Paul here over email and a Paul would like to talk a little bit more about the inappropriate tactics being used by schools and his question is what are some of the inappropriate tactics schools are using to recruit Veterans and what makes them so inappropriate I think students feel it\'s inappropriate when they\'ve told the school that they\'re no longer interested in attending that school and yet the school still calls and emails them we had students tell us that they had been receiving daily emails and phone calls despite the fact that they had told the schools that they were no longer interested in those programs and I think at that point it became it becomes too much for the students another question over email from Allison and Allison would like to know are these recruiting tactics affecting a lot of veterans I think our survey results show that tens of thousands of veterans are being affected so this is really not a situation where you have onesies and twosies saying that they had a bad experience selecting a school or being recruited by a school our results show that tens of thousands of student veterans are feeling pressure to enroll and feeling like they are being coerced in a way that is not appropriate let me turn to another question we got over email from Charles and this question is getting at the post 911 GI Bill and he would like to know how many veterans are using the post 911 GI bill that\'s a great question we actually have a figure that shows just that it\'s figure 2 here and what this figure shows is both the GI bill benefit program and sort of the larger range of other programs and you can see in the bar chart that the the darker color there is the GI bill program so we have all together about a million participants receiving veterans education benefits in about three fourths of them about 750,000 are receiving the post 911 GI bill funds and what\'s interesting is when you look at this chart you can see the number of people receiving GI bill benefits growing over time well let me ask you then why have we seen this grow then it looks like it\'s also growing fairly quickly yes yes I think it\'s something that connects with the fact that we have a lot of people coming back from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and this enables them to transition to civilian life to get a degree to join the workforce in addition the benefit is very helpful in that it provides for tuition as well as living expenses and books so it\'s something that I think encourages people to think about going back to school and our next question comes from David over email David would like to know why to some schools focus on recruiting veterans I think it\'s because they have tuition assistance quite frankly a lot of other students don\'t have that and they need to take out loans and yet here\'s money that these students are bringing with them and so I think that\'s something that\'s very appealing to schools that are looking for students who don\'t need to take out loans necessarily if someone has been on active duty for 36 months they are entitled to four years of in-state public school tuition and so that\'s something that I think is appealing to the schools and in your report your team also talked to some schools when you were doing the investigative work and how many school or the schools that you spoke with what did they tell you about their recruitment practices or how they were trying to do their outreach to students right they focus on how they wanted to serve the communities they want to serve the veterans coming back and they would call them they would email them they would do advertisements in newspapers they would sometimes visit bases go to college fairs have office hours where perhaps current military students would talk about their experiences with prospective students so there were a variety of strategies that they use to specifically connect with student veterans and they were aware that folks were student veterans they were tracking that information so they knew based on them asking are you a veteran up front or perhaps just tracking how the person entered the website so if a person entered a school\'s website through the page for veterans they would know that they potentially were a veteran because they were interested in that topic and you\'ve mentioned previously how the schools have their website set up and we have a question here from Christie over email who would like to know how do schools use their websites to recruit better student veterans that\'s an excellent question Christie they do it in a variety of ways so some of them will have separate pages for the sort of veteran experience and they\'ll advertise it that way they also may place advertisements on other websites to drive traffic to their school website they may also use like lead generators which are third parties that would sort of encourage people to provide contact information if they want to go back to school and then they would share that information with the school that might want to connect with that veteran there were also some that we spoke with that bot list of military family addresses living in an area and then would send them direct mail so there are different ways that people reach out to the veteran population and the web is very significant one and veterans told us that they did rely on the web in that decision-making process so that was something that was helpful for them thank you and I\'m just going to say again how you can send in your questions we can send you can send them in over email to the email address ask gio live at geo gov and thanks again for everybody who has been sending in your questions over email and again you can also send them in over twitter using the hashtag ask gio live we do have our first question that came in from Twitter it\'s from Steve and Steve would like to know if a veteran from 1972 to 2001 I\'m so prior to the post 911 GI bill would they be eligible for education veterans education benefits and what about also the children of those that\'s a great question there are programs prior to the post 911 GI Bill program that serve veterans from earlier periods of time and I would encourage you to go on the VA\'s website I believe we actually have a figure on that you can look at figure 6 which is about the GI bill but you\'ll also be able to use that to link to other programs there\'s the Montgomery GI Bill which predates the post 9-11 one as well as other pre-existing educational benefit programs for veterans so there are other programs that are available for people from earlier periods of service and in the current post 911 GI Bill program I know that there are certain provisions that allow people to pass on their benefits to children and you could look depending on what you might be eligible for you can see if the other programs do that as well thanks Mel so that\'s really helpful to be able to share that information with folks we have another question here over email from Terry and Terry would like to know could you provide more information on education and career counseling for veterans sure so I there are several options available for folks so there is the the live in-person kind of guidance counselor option which is the educational counseling that the Department of Veterans Affairs offers which is an option that not enough people are taking advantage of in fact less than 2% of all eligible veterans actually even applied for that service so I think that\'s something that is available that more people could be aware of in addition there\'s a really interesting tool called career scope which is on VA\'s website and actually think we have a slide on that as well and that would be slide 6 in terms of some of the resources and career scope lets you kind of play with the app and figure out what kind of career or occupation you might want to have so it\'s it\'s not an in-person a tool but it does provide assistance in thinking through what kind of career you might want to have and so that\'s something that\'s also available to people through the VA that might be of assistance we have another question here from Robert over email and robber would like to know will institutions so you\'d be mandated to have a one-stop shop rather than identify or one point of contact to assist veterans and reservist with VA education benefits and tuition assistance and is there anything else related to military or veterans benefits and if you agree what would be some of the positive impacts of such a program where you could get the sort of one-stop shopping that\'s that\'s a really interesting question there is a comparison tool that the Department of Veterans Affairs recently created and that\'s also on slide six and you can link directly from that to there and that\'s a tool that allows people to compare different schools in terms of graduation rates in terms of other information and I think that might be more of the sort of one-stop shopping that would be helpful versus maybe kind of going to multiple sites to collect information so that might be a really good resource we have a interesting question here from George over email George would like to know if you could tell us the schools that were surveyed for this report and also specifically which schools were sort of guilty of this nefarious or inappropriate recruitment practices so we surveyed students who had received benefits so they could have gone to any school that received benefits in terms of the GI Bill so we did not ask for the names of the schools we wanted to make sure that we received very open and honest information from the students and did not want them to feel like they had to somehow protect an institution so that is not information that that we gathered but I do think it\'s troubling when you have tens of thousands of students saying that they\'ve experienced problems with recruitment it is clearly not about a single school in that situation I\'m going to turn you a question now that came in over Twitter Carlton Purvis and Carlton would like to know he says it\'s interesting that veterans are feeling targeted by schools he feels like the opposite that vets offices at schools are sometimes indifferent or even a loof so really not that persistent contact that and so how does it sort of gel or mesh with what you heard from veteran right I think what\'s happening is that some people are having more positive experiences and others are not and there are a lot of veterans out there as I said there are 73 thousand veterans that were receiving GI Bill benefits for the very first time in 2012 so you could really have a range of experiences I think there is also this issue we\'ve reported on this previously that some schools provide more support services for veterans than other schools do and this is something that could be in the form of a lounge for veterans or counseling for veterans or maybe even sensitivity training for faculty so that they\'re sensitive to the experience of veterans coming back to school so there is really a range in terms of support services provided to veterans and I think it\'s interesting because there are unique challenges that veterans face during this transition and we actually have a slide I believe its figure 4 which lays out some of those challenges that veterans experience in that transition from military to civilian life many of these students are older they may have families they may also have service-connected disabilities coming from the military and they\'re really navigating not just sort of their classwork and figuring out you know where to sign up for courses and you know where to live but they\'re also trying to figure out how to do that with these additional challenges in place and so I think that raises the importance of support services for these students we have an interesting and a related question from Mike over email and Mike would like to know how our veterans making these decisions about where to go to school that\'s a really good question Mike we found that they are relying on the communication that they receive from school so they are looking to schools for information about the programs they are also factoring in the cost of their programs if their tuition is not fully covered if you know they haven\'t done the 36 months of service then they might not have for years covered and they\'re also looking at location that matters they you know may want to school in a particular area so that\'s another factor that they\'re considering well let me ask you then how are the factors that student veterans are considering possibly different from other students I think one of them is related to the idea of support services for veterans so kind of going back to figure 1 I think that was one of the biggest items that people told us that they needed information on because they felt like they didn\'t know enough about support services for veterans at the campus something else that\'s really unique and you can see this again in this table here is the issue of their credits transferring so they may have earned some credits in the military and they want to transfer those to college that\'s a very unique situation that\'s not applicable to civilian life so that\'s also very different so there are some unique issues that affect the information that they\'re interested in I\'m going to turn to a question from Zach over email and Zach would like to know what\'s VA doing to help veterans get information about schools so VA has issued or developed a complaint system that is up and running in that I believe is a figure 5 as well and you can see you can submit a complaint so that\'s also helpful for people to be aware of if anyone is out there in the audience today and if you\'ve had a negative experience and you\'d like to address it please go forward and submit a complaint the Department of Veterans Affairs so that is a new online system that they have developed they are also developing other systems to provide more information to students one of our concerns though has been that a lot of these projects that they\'ve been working on have come in late and it\'s a challenge because they have a lot on their plate at the department of veterans affairs but at the same time a lot of the planning has really been on a month-to-month basis and they\'ve been missing deadlines so we ended up making a recommendation that they do better project planning so that they can really ensure that the projects that they\'re doing for veterans are done on time we have a follow-up question from Robert who sent us an email previously and is actually a clarification on his earlier question and it is do you feel as though institution so colleges and campuses will soon be required to serve or create a one stop shop or physical location for veterans military reservists rather than having multiple offices involved in the process of enrolling and continuing to utilize their education benefits but that\'s a good question Robert I\'m not familiar with any such legislative proposals at this time I know that there\'s a lot of other stuff going on in terms of requirements on the Department of Veterans Affairs they\'ve needed to develop this complaint system they\'re also doing a feedback system which I think will also incorporate positive reviews so that you know you could kind of think about you know what are people experiencing at schools and maybe see if people had some good experiences and maybe look to that so the Department of Veterans Affairs is also doing the feedback system and they\'re also trying to provide better information to veterans for their comparison tool so right now the information on the comparison tool may provide sauder estimates about how much financial aid someone may be eligible for and I think they\'re looking to make it more personalized to the veterans they\'re also looking to provide more specific outcome data on student veterans at those campuses so there are quite a few other initiatives ongoing that the department is currently doing in response to federal requirements to help make sure that students get the information that they need we\'ve got a few minutes left here so I do want to make sure to ask about the recommendations from the report you touched on one of them earlier but could you tell us more about the recommendations that you made in this report I think given the troubling findings we really think that the Department of Veterans Affairs could do more to market its educational counseling service to veterans I mean this is something that could clearly help veterans during this period they\'re getting a lot of hard sell information from schools many of them like I said baby first generation and they could really use some assistance navigating this information and this counseling is free and it is available one-on-one so we think they could do more and for example we have a slide its slide 3 which is really interesting because they have this service advertised but they advertise it really late in the process so you think they would advertise the educational counseling under the exploring your career and you know comparing schools and choosing a school but you can see on this graphic that they don\'t actually do that they advertise it way late in terms of succeeding in school and while counseling may be helpful to stay in school we think that there\'s a real opportunity to make sure people get counseling early and upfront and that\'s something that\'s not currently happening let me turn to a question from John over email and John would like to know does your report suggests that schools should not be recruiting student veterans no oh we think it\'s a good thing that that student veterans go to school and they rely on information and they find that communication very helpful it\'s it\'s good for them to know about the programs and the like I think it\'s just a question of having additional support to really kind of navigate the information that they are receiving so that that is not the only source of information that they are getting about a school and I think sources like the Department of Veterans Affairs comparison tool could be really helpful for people to compare schools so that they\'re not reliant on a single recruiter who may not have their best interests in mind well let me ask you what do you see as the bottom line of this report and for the key takeaway for folks I think the key takeaway for folks is that this is not an issue of you know just a handful of people having negative recruitment experiences although many have positive recruitment experiences tens of thousands feel like they\'re being excessively contacted feel coerced and feel like they\'re being provided inaccurate information and we feel like that needs to be addressed in the Department of Veterans Affairs needs to proactively help these people by providing educational counseling well Melissa thank

much for taking the time to tune in and join us today my name is Sarah caz Merrick I\'m in our office of public affairs i\'m joined today by a new guest Melissa Emory eres a director in Gio\'s education workforce an income security team Melissa thanks so much for joining us today thanks so much for having me here and today we\'re going to be talking about veterans and higher education Melissa\'s team recently released a report on this topic looking in part at schools recruitment of student veterans for a little more context or information about the report you can find online in our website that\'s Gao gov and the report number to look for is Gao 14 324 and you can find it right there on our homepage again it\'s geo dish 14 dash 324 so before we get started I want to talk about how you can send in your questions for the chat today we\'ve already gotten a few questions in over email and thanks for those of you who have set in your questions already you can send them in over email to ask GL live at Gao gov if you\'re on social media you can also send them in over Twitter just use the hashtag ask gio live so we\'ll be keeping an eye out for your emails and tweets and we\'ll do our best to get you a response so Melissa could you start us off with an introduction to yourself and your work at Gao sure I work on education issues and we do national studies on everything from elementary school in high school to college issues and I focus a lot on higher education so this is college trade school for older students and we\'ve done work ranging from covering the cost of student loans to the cost of textbooks to what it\'s like for veterans returning as students with their GI Bill benefits and we\'ve done several reports on this topic including the one that was released yesterday and could you tell us a little bit more about the report that came out yesterday look schools recruitment of student veterans happy to do so this is a very exciting report prior to this report there had only been anecdotal information on the experience of student veterans during that school search in a recruitment process and we actually obtained nationally generalizable data about this population so we have real numbers to talk about the experience of students using their GI Bill benefits to go to school well let me jump right in and ask you then what did veterans tell you about their experience being recruited by schools we found that thousands of veterans were experiencing negative recruitment processes when being recruited by schools and what that comes down to is veterans told us that they were being contacted excessively by schools in terms of the number of emails and phone calls that they were receiving and the numbers of veterans affected by this is significant our survey shows that about fifteen thousand veterans reported having negative experiences with schools in terms of excessive contact beyond that closer to seven thousand veterans indicated that they had experiences feeling coerced into attending a school so this is a significant concern given that these veterans have served our country and we want them to have a good transition to college life and yet they\'re feeling harassed and coerced when they\'re in this process of selecting a school well let me turn to the first question that we\'ve gotten from our audience here a question comes from dan over email and dan would like to know how many veterans did we survey in this report sure so our survey results are generalizable to the whole population of veterans that first started receiving benefits in 2012 and that was seventy three thousand veterans so we did a statistical sample of surveying 900 of them but it actually is generalized to that whole population of 73 thousand people receiving GI Bill benefits for the first time in 2012 and Dan had a second question for us and his question is did you report all look at graduation rates for these student veterans our report asked veterans what information they wanted and they wanted information on graduate graduation rates and actually we have a figure on that it\'s figure 1 if you look at that this is not the actual graduation rate of student veterans but it\'s the percentage of students we surveyed who said that they wanted more information on graduation rates and you can see here in this graphic that they also wanted more information on support services for veterans on campus as well as information on transferring credits and also how much they were going to be on the hook for in terms of student loan debt when they graduated well turning back to what veterans said to it said in the survey I have a question here from Sam over email and Sam would like to know if that\'s felt like they were being lied to or misled by the schools we we did hear that we had a significant number of veterans tell us that they were receiving inaccurate information and when you look at the actual numbers of people affected it\'s about 16,000 veterans reported receiving what they thought of as inaccurate information and this could be on graduation rates that they were being told by the school or it could be about financial aid or job placement rates so this is really key information and they felt like they were not receiving the truth from schools let me ask you to follow our very related question that came in from Randy over email and Randy would like to know is it harder for veterans to get it good information about schools and if so why would that be that\'s a good question i think veterans are coming from the military so they\'re not coming from a high school with maybe a guidance counselor to sit with them and kind of guide them through the process and many of the veterans coming back maybe first-generation college students so they may be coming from families without those supports in place and it\'s not always easy to find the information that you need we actually looked at a lot of these websites and had trouble ourselves finding information so we were looking for information on the graduation rates or the job placement rates and sometimes you would find it in these obscure corners of the website like consumer disclosures places that no one in their right mind would ever visit and that\'s where they put this information and people couldn\'t find it and I think that\'s what you\'re seeing there in that graphic is that people wanted information it felt like they couldn\'t find it that\'s got to make it really challenging for vets as they try to make informed choices about what schools they might want to attend yes very much so and one of our recommendations in this report is to make sure that they have more assistance in making those choices and it\'s interesting the Department of Veterans Affairs actually has something like a guidance counselor they have counselors who are available to provide assistance regarding educational counseling and it\'s free for folks who have these GI Bill benefits and it\'s one-on-one yet about half of the people that we surveyed had no knowledge that this existed that\'s got to be a big challenge it is i\'m going to turn to our next question from erica over an email and Erica would like to know how is veteran recruitment different from regular student recruitment or recruitment of other kinds of students that\'s a great question Thank You Erica for posing it I think it\'s different for veterans because they have specific offices at schools that are focused on veteran recruitment so they may have particular officials whose sole job it is to look for student veterans to encourage them to apply for their schools so they tailor email and phone communications to the veteran population they advertise in print and online media for veterans and if you go on a lot of schools websites you\'ll see a lot of images about people wearing military clothing the websites will cite that their military friendly and the like so I think there\'s a big push to enroll students who are veterans and who have GI Bill benefits we have a really good question from Paul here over email and a Paul would like to talk a little bit more about the inappropriate tactics being used by schools and his question is what are some of the inappropriate tactics schools are using to recruit Veterans and what makes them so inappropriate I think students feel it\'s inappropriate when they\'ve told the school that they\'re no longer interested in attending that school and yet the school still calls and emails them we had students tell us that they had been receiving daily emails and phone calls despite the fact that they had told the schools that they were no longer interested in those programs and I think at that point it became it becomes too much for the students another question over email from Allison and Allison would like to know are these recruiting tactics affecting a lot of veterans I think our survey results show that tens of thousands of veterans are being affected so this is really not a situation where you have onesies and twosies saying that they had a bad experience selecting a school or being recruited by a school our results show that tens of thousands of student veterans are feeling pressure to enroll and feeling like they are being coerced in a way that is not appropriate let me turn to another question we got over email from Charles and this question is getting at the post 911 GI Bill and he would like to know how many veterans are using the post 911 GI bill that\'s a great question we actually have a figure that shows just that it\'s figure 2 here and what this figure shows is both the GI bill benefit program and sort of the larger range of other programs and you can see in the bar chart that the the darker color there is the GI bill program so we have all together about a million participants receiving veterans education benefits in about three fourths of them about 750,000 are receiving the post 911 GI bill funds and what\'s interesting is when you look at this chart you can see the number of people receiving GI bill benefits growing over time well let me ask you then why have we seen this grow then it looks like it\'s also growing fairly quickly yes yes I think it\'s something that connects with the fact that we have a lot of people coming back from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and this enables them to transition to civilian life to get a degree to join the workforce in addition the benefit is very helpful in that it provides for tuition as well as living expenses and books so it\'s something that I think encourages people to think about going back to school and our next question comes from David over email David would like to know why to some schools focus on recruiting veterans I think it\'s because they have tuition assistance quite frankly a lot of other students don\'t have that and they need to take out loans and yet here\'s money that these students are bringing with them and so I think that\'s something that\'s very appealing to schools that are looking for students who don\'t need to take out loans necessarily if someone has been on active duty for 36 months they are entitled to four years of in-state public school tuition and so that\'s something that I think is appealing to the schools and in your report your team also talked to some schools when you were doing the investigative work and how many school or the schools that you spoke with what did they tell you about their recruitment practices or how they were trying to do their outreach to students right they focus on how they wanted to serve the communities they want to serve the veterans coming back and they would call them they would email them they would do advertisements in newspapers they would sometimes visit bases go to college fairs have office hours where perhaps current military students would talk about their experiences with prospective students so there were a variety of strategies that they use to specifically connect with student veterans and they were aware that folks were student veterans they were tracking that information so they knew based on them asking are you a veteran up front or perhaps just tracking how the person entered the website so if a person entered a school\'s website through the page for veterans they would know that they potentially were a veteran because they were interested in that topic and you\'ve mentioned previously how the schools have their website set up and we have a question here from Christie over email who would like to know how do schools use their websites to recruit better student veterans that\'s an excellent question Christie they do it in a variety of ways so some of them will have separate pages for the sort of veteran experience and they\'ll advertise it that way they also may place advertisements on other websites to drive traffic to their school website they may also use like lead generators which are third parties that would sort of encourage people to provide contact information if they want to go back to school and then they would share that information with the school that might want to connect with that veteran there were also some that we spoke with that bot list of military family addresses living in an area and then would send them direct mail so there are different ways that people reach out to the veteran population and the web is very significant one and veterans told us that they did rely on the web in that decision-making process so that was something that was helpful for them thank you and I\'m just going to say again how you can send in your questions we can send you can send them in over email to the email address ask gio live at geo gov and thanks again for everybody who has been sending in your questions over email and again you can also send them in over twitter using the hashtag ask gio live we do have our first question that came in from Twitter it\'s from Steve and Steve would like to know if a veteran from 1972 to 2001 I\'m so prior to the post 911 GI bill would they be eligible for education veterans education benefits and what about also the children of those that\'s a great question there are programs prior to the post 911 GI Bill program that serve veterans from earlier periods of time and I would encourage you to go on the VA\'s website I believe we actually have a figure on that you can look at figure 6 which is about the GI bill but you\'ll also be able to use that to link to other programs there\'s the Montgomery GI Bill which predates the post 9-11 one as well as other pre-existing educational benefit programs for veterans so there are other programs that are available for people from earlier periods of service and in the current post 911 GI Bill program I know that there are certain provisions that allow people to pass on their benefits to children and you could look depending on what you might be eligible for you can see if the other programs do that as well thanks Mel so that\'s really helpful to be able to share that information with folks we have another question here over email from Terry and Terry would like to know could you provide more information on education and career counseling for veterans sure so I there are several options available for folks so there is the the live in-person kind of guidance counselor option which is the educational counseling that the Department of Veterans Affairs offers which is an option that not enough people are taking advantage of in fact less than 2% of all eligible veterans actually even applied for that service so I think that\'s something that is available that more people could be aware of in addition there\'s a really interesting tool called career scope which is on VA\'s website and actually think we have a slide on that as well and that would be slide 6 in terms of some of the resources and career scope lets you kind of play with the app and figure out what kind of career or occupation you might want to have so it\'s it\'s not an in-person a tool but it does provide assistance in thinking through what kind of career you might want to have and so that\'s something that\'s also available to people through the VA that might be of assistance we have another question here from Robert over email and robber would like to know will institutions so you\'d be mandated to have a one-stop shop rather than identify or one point of contact to assist veterans and reservist with VA education benefits and tuition assistance and is there anything else related to military or veterans benefits and if you agree what would be some of the positive impacts of such a program where you could get the sort of one-stop shopping that\'s that\'s a really interesting question there is a comparison tool that the Department of Veterans Affairs recently created and that\'s also on slide six and you can link directly from that to there and that\'s a tool that allows people to compare different schools in terms of graduation rates in terms of other information and I think that might be more of the sort of one-stop shopping that would be helpful versus maybe kind of going to multiple sites to collect information so that might be a really good resource we have a interesting question here from George over email George would like to know if you could tell us the schools that were surveyed for this report and also specifically which schools were sort of guilty of this nefarious or inappropriate recruitment practices so we surveyed students who had received benefits so they could have gone to any school that received benefits in terms of the GI Bill so we did not ask for the names of the schools we wanted to make sure that we received very open and honest information from the students and did not want them to feel like they had to somehow protect an institution so that is not information that that we gathered but I do think it\'s troubling when you have tens of thousands of students saying that they\'ve experienced problems with recruitment it is clearly not about a single school in that situation I\'m going to turn you a question now that came in over Twitter Carlton Purvis and Carlton would like to know he says it\'s interesting that veterans are feeling targeted by schools he feels like the opposite that vets offices at schools are sometimes indifferent or even a loof so really not that persistent contact that and so how does it sort of gel or mesh with what you heard from veteran right I think what\'s happening is that some people are having more positive experiences and others are not and there are a lot of veterans out there as I said there are 73 thousand veterans that were receiving GI Bill benefits for the very first time in 2012 so you could really have a range of experiences I think there is also this issue we\'ve reported on this previously that some schools provide more support services for veterans than other schools do and this is something that could be in the form of a lounge for veterans or counseling for veterans or maybe even sensitivity training for faculty so that they\'re sensitive to the experience of veterans coming back to school so there is really a range in terms of support services provided to veterans and I think it\'s interesting because there are unique challenges that veterans face during this transition and we actually have a slide I believe its figure 4 which lays out some of those challenges that veterans experience in that transition from military to civilian life many of these students are older they may have families they may also have service-connected disabilities coming from the military and they\'re really navigating not just sort of their classwork and figuring out you know where to sign up for courses and you know where to live but they\'re also trying to figure out how to do that with these additional challenges in place and so I think that raises the importance of support services for these students we have an interesting and a related question from Mike over email and Mike would like to know how our veterans making these decisions about where to go to school that\'s a really good question Mike we found that they are relying on the communication that they receive from school so they are looking to schools for information about the programs they are also factoring in the cost of their programs if their tuition is not fully covered if you know they haven\'t done the 36 months of service then they might not have for years covered and they\'re also looking at location that matters they you know may want to school in a particular area so that\'s another factor that they\'re considering well let me ask you then how are the factors that student veterans are considering possibly different from other students I think one of them is related to the idea of support services for veterans so kind of going back to figure 1 I think that was one of the biggest items that people told us that they needed information on because they felt like they didn\'t know enough about support services for veterans at the campus something else that\'s really unique and you can see this again in this table here is the issue of their credits transferring so they may have earned some credits in the military and they want to transfer those to college that\'s a very unique situation that\'s not applicable to civilian life so that\'s also very different so there are some unique issues that affect the information that they\'re interested in I\'m going to turn to a question from Zach over email and Zach would like to know what\'s VA doing to help veterans get information about schools so VA has issued or developed a complaint system that is up and running in that I believe is a figure 5 as well and you can see you can submit a complaint so that\'s also helpful for people to be aware of if anyone is out there in the audience today and if you\'ve had a negative experience and you\'d like to address it please go forward and submit a complaint the Department of Veterans Affairs so that is a new online system that they have developed they are also developing other systems to provide more information to students one of our concerns though has been that a lot of these projects that they\'ve been working on have come in late and it\'s a challenge because they have a lot on their plate at the department of veterans affairs but at the same time a lot of the planning has really been on a month-to-month basis and they\'ve been missing deadlines so we ended up making a recommendation that they do better project planning so that they can really ensure that the projects that they\'re doing for veterans are done on time we have a follow-up question from Robert who sent us an email previously and is actually a clarification on his earlier question and it is do you feel as though institution so colleges and campuses will soon be required to serve or create a one stop shop or physical location for veterans military reservists rather than having multiple offices involved in the process of enrolling and continuing to utilize their education benefits but that\'s a good question Robert I\'m not familiar with any such legislative proposals at this time I know that there\'s a lot of other stuff going on in terms of requirements on the Department of Veterans Affairs they\'ve needed to develop this complaint system they\'re also doing a feedback system which I think will also incorporate positive reviews so that you know you could kind of think about you know what are people experiencing at schools and maybe see if people had some good experiences and maybe look to that so the Department of Veterans Affairs is also doing the feedback system and they\'re also trying to provide better information to veterans for their comparison tool so right now the information on the comparison tool may provide sauder estimates about how much financial aid someone may be eligible for and I think they\'re looking to make it more personalized to the veterans they\'re also looking to provide more specific outcome data on student veterans at those campuses so there are quite a few other initiatives ongoing that the department is currently doing in response to federal requirements to help make sure that students get the information that they need we\'ve got a few minutes left here so I do want to make sure to ask about the recommendations from the report you touched on one of them earlier but could you tell us more about the recommendations that you made in this report I think given the troubling findings we really think that the Department of Veterans Affairs could do more to market its educational counseling service to veterans I mean this is something that could clearly help veterans during this period they\'re getting a lot of hard sell information from schools many of them like I said baby first generation and they could really use some assistance navigating this information and this counseling is free and it is available one-on-one so we think they could do more and for example we have a slide its slide 3 which is really interesting because they have this service advertised but they advertise it really late in the process so you think they would advertise the educational counseling under the exploring your career and you know comparing schools and choosing a school but you can see on this graphic that they don\'t actually do that they advertise it way late in terms of succeeding in school and while counseling may be helpful to stay in school we think that there\'s a real opportunity to make sure people get counseling early and upfront and that\'s something that\'s not currently happening let me turn to a question from John over email and John would like to know does your report suggests that schools should not be recruiting student veterans no oh we think it\'s a good thing that that student veterans go to school and they rely on information and they find that communication very helpful it\'s it\'s good for them to know about the programs and the like I think it\'s just a question of having additional support to really kind of navigate the information that they are receiving so that that is not the only source of information that they are getting about a school and I think sources like the Department of Veterans Affairs comparison tool could be really helpful for people to compare schools so that they\'re not reliant on a single recruiter who may not have their best interests in mind well let me ask you what do you see as the bottom line of this report and for the key takeaway for folks I think the key takeaway for folks is that this is not an issue of you know just a handful of people having negative recruitment experiences although many have positive recruitment experiences tens of thousands feel like they\'re being excessively contacted feel coerced and feel like they\'re being provided inaccurate information and we feel like that needs to be addressed in the Department of Veterans Affairs needs to proactively help these people by providing educational counseling well Melissa thank you so much for joining us today and talking about this very important issue thanks so much for having me here Sarah we were very happy to have you here and thanks everybody who tuned in and joined us
